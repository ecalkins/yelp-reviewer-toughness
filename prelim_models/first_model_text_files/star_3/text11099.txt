When we got there, there were lots of people standing around waiting for a table and while I was pretty hungry, I was starting to question my decision to try it.  The kids did a great job of entertaining themselves and the wait was only about 10 minutes with a group of 5.  The waiter was very impressive, working with us on kids meals and the request for extra rice for my daughter that can never get enough rice in her life.  They were great with the kids and everything flowed very well.  Food was very authentic and tasty.  I got the shrimp burrito, T got the bean burrito.
