The meal is a great deal. With that being said this place is a dirt hole. Example after I ate there walking out , a shirtless guy was being arrested. Same trip almost forgot that the paramedics were their inside haling some guy out . If you want cheap steak off the strip, and you love the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , check this place out you will feel like a scene  form the movie . If you go at night I'd go in a large group or hide your money in your shoe, Enjoy.
