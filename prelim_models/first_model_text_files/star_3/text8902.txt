Food: steak and eggs for 5.99? Sure!  This isn't any angus beef rated steak but for the amount of money, why not eat it?  If you like your steak a little rare inside or even medium rare, ask for rare.  Why?  They cook it two ways, well done or rare.  The rare is a little pink inside and the medium rare is where their well done starts.  Not because they don't know how to cook, just because the steak is so thin.   The Sides it comes with is usually pretty decent too.

Service:  The service is SLOW.  I mean SUPER SLOW.  If you were waiting for your steak to cook on the sidewalk outside during the hottest day of summer in Vegas, you'd probably have a steak sooner than in this place.  They wait staff has a lot of tables to serve and they're also under staffed.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  This place is great to chill with friends while waiting for your cheap food.  It's just a thing to note if you're in a rush.

Overall, great prices for decent food and slow service.  It's vegas and it's off the strip, what do you want?  

I'd go back."
