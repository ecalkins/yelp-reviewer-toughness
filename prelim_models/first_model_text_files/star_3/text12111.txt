Note the signs around the parking area and make sure you're not parked in the spaces of the adjacent hotel to avoid the risk of being towed. The waffles that came with the chicken were good; the fried chicken I had was tasty but on the dry side. The green beans I had on the side were mushy and tasteless. There are items on the menu I'd like to try in the future, although I'm not sure if the pricey fare would be worth the trip. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because the interior really looks nice.
