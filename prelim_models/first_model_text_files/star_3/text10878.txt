 BUT service was slow...horribly slow. With 3 tables total I don't really think it should take 10 minutes to get a glass of water or a pot of tea. Let alone the length of time we waited for our food. 

Maybe our server was distracted by other things but eh...I rather just order food to go and call it a day."
