Walking around nearly 1 1/2 hours with empty stomach, I was starving by the time I was finished with my business!  So I looked up a breakfast & brunch in the area. 

I had several choices:  Baby-Stacks, Egg works, Cracked Egg, Daily Egg, etc.  But I chose this location because I have tried Baby Stacks and Egg Works; and I figured Cracked Egg and Daily Egg would be very similar to Egg Works.  So I decided to try this place.

I ordered Surfs Up Veggie Scramble and Cappuccino....  I ate the whole thing, but I would not say that it was good.  I mean. I was definitely hungry and so I ate.  Usually when I'm hungry, I feel like the food tastes better... However, I just thought I should eat because I'm hungry... 

The cappuccino was a little luke-warm and not hot enough.  The roasted potatoes(?) were decent but the scrambled egg (the main dish) was a little bland and too oily.  Adding ketchup to it helped the bland flavor.

The service was very casual and I'm not complaining.  It is a casual dining place, and I do not expect much.  I cannot say that the staff is friendly though... The server did her job definitely.  She wasn't mean or rude.  She just did her job. So I would just a smile would have been nicer.  

I am not sure if I will go back.  I mean, if I am in the neighborhood again, I would probably hit up another breakfast cafe to try.  However, I wouldn't mind eating here again and trying one of their burgers and smoothies... IF this is the closest location."
