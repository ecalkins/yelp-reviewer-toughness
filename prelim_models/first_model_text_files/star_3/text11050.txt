Ok so my review is based on the food, first of all don't come to this place if your expectations are to have some amazing Mexican food. 
This is more of the Americanized Mexican food and while it isn't that bad I can't really say that it was all that good. 
I had the chimichanga platter which to be honest was ok. The meat was tasty (shredded beef) but that was it. The rice was not very good and it was mushy. The beans also did not taste good. The salsa had this fishy after taste. They only have one stall in the bathroom so if it's packed, good luck. The service was good and in all fairness the food was not that bad it just to me was not what I would consider Mexican. I personally feel that this place is ok and if you come with the expectation that you are not getting authentic Mexican food than you will like it. On a positive note they have coke products."
