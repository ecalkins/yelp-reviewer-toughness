We ordered ""the steak special"" another one of LV's famous local kind of ""off the menu item"". guess its not so off the menu when I saw it on a billboard in the hallway by the RR. It was good but not unforgettable, but great value for the price. the place was popping and every single person around me ordered ""the steak special"" with baked potato which was really good. no cheese or bacon but comes w/ butter and sour cream you can add @ your own discretion (unlike longhorn casino that they pile a pound of each in ur potato and it must be removed)
I want to say it also comes w/ a beer. you cant beat that deal. 
Id order it again, but only after finally trying the mr lucky special! 

TIP: dont forget the pick 6!"
