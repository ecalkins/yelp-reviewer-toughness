It is amazing! We also really enjoy the cornbread (huge, moist and actual corn in it), the Mac and cheese, and the spicy corn fritters. They have many great drink options as well. The Georgia drink and even the lemonade and sweet teas are great. I like asking for an Arnold Palmer. The waffles, catfish, grits, fried green tomatoes and greens are all lacking flavor and we would not try those again.  Looking forward to when the new  Gilbert location gets it's act together, as it is much closer and we would like to try something new at LoLo's. Definitely worth a visit!
