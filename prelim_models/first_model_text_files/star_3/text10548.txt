TONKOTSU - there's a choice of thick or thin noodles. I chose thin. The broth was flavourful and not too salty, but unfortunately it wasn't hot. The pork belly was the best part of the dish! They were large, thick slices and I even ordered EXTRA CHASIU (2 extra slices of pork belly),not knowing that a total of 4 slices is actually too much. Next time, I won't need to order extra dishes. 

DAIFUKU - Chocolate dusted rice balls filled with Japanese cream cheese. Note: The cream cheese is unsweetened.

The service was fast and the servers were very friendly recommending dishes to us!"
