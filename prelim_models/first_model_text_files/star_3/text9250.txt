We went a few days ago and not so much, I ordered it the same way I did before , but this time it was tough and did not have the same good taste it had before. I ate the potato , and salad . My husband didn't like his at all .He ate his soup . I don't know what was different this time but we was not happy at all , sorry. If we go back we will get something different.
