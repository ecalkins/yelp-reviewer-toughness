Staff was hard to distinguish. Signs for various areas of casino were okay. We elected to try out the restaurant here. 

Host staff took some time. Wait staff was helpful. Kitchen took some time. Wait staff provided items on menu could not be modified. We ordered off the menu. I don't recall the actual meal ordered. It came reasonable timed. Not a bad breakfast but not a great breakfast. I have definitely have had better.

Restaurant was a bit busy. Plenty of areas were being cleaned during my visit.

My visit was okay. Not quite my cup of tea. Considering it's in Vegas I wished pricing and food were competitive to the major casinos."
