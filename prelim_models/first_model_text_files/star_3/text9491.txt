They have a good assortment of Machines to gamble on again it is not a big casino but they have a few I have played, Drinks are free while you gamble.

They do have a bar with karaoke and it can get pretty loud near there.
They also have a sports book which they did not have years ago.
Over all its a good place to go if you want some cheap and good food!!
It is not too far from the strip to walk it is almost exactly behind Bally's.
We recommend if you want a smaller casino or some good inexpensive food come check this place out!!!"
