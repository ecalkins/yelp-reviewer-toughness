It's quite good, probably one of my favourites there. Recently, I also tried the Spicy Tantan, which has minced pork and bean sprouts in addition to the ingredients in Shoyu. I didn't really like it, it was way too salty. I had to down 2 cups of water after. My advice is to stay away from this one, but all other ramens are quite good.
