It was really cold and every time someone came in, a cold gust of wind hit us. Fortunately, ramen is eaten quickly. The food itself was great - the broth was really rich and noodles were fresh. I had the tonkotsu black ramen and it was quite good. Service was decent - our orders were taken fairly quickly and we were out of there within an hour. Minus a star for not having a double door...
