I'm usually ok with noise but we had to shout across the table to talk to each other and that was annoying.

Let's get to the food:
The menu has a fun variety of egg dishes as well as some creative pancakes and waffles.

I had the cinnamon roll pancakes and my husband had an omlette.

The portions are huge!

If you don't do dairy in your coffee they do offer almond milk.

I based my stars on the wait time for our meal and our drinks were never refreshed. I had finished my coffee well before our food arrived. I had water, but i really would have loved more coffee.

Nice decor!"
