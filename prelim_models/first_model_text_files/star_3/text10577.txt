We waited outside for about 10 mins and were seated quickly in a long table with others. I had the black miso and my friend had the spicy tantan with thick noodles. They were both just ok, definitely not good enough to justify the line outside. I thought the portions were kind of small and we both left with too much room for dessert. Besides the food, service was good, the server was super friendly.
