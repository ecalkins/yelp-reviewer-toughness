Note in order to get the deal you have to get a players card and spend a certain amount. Only then do you get a discount and only on one plate. Kind of misleading.

The wait went by quickly due to the bar & slots. Drink prices are amazing, I think I had whiskey & coke for $2. The service during dinner was decent but the food was barely average. 

There are better places to eat in vegas but if your looking for a deal I guess this will do."
