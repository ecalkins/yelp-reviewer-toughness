I had the mango lime crepe it was alright but too much hard mango it need something more than that in the crepe.. It was still alright.. But I wish I gad something else. My aunt had eggs Benedict and we had to ask for more sauce.. But she said she like them. My friend had plain buttermilk pancakes.. Said they were good. Service was excellent. I liked want I saw on the menu so I will try them out again.
