Ambience is kinda sports bar/ hooters hip hop chain restaurant trying too hard to be hipster but also trying to appeal to the family diners. Chicken is well fried but lacks a little spice or kick. Waffle was too thin and limp to hold up to the chicken. Cole slaw was tangy and vinegary- was legit.  Overall a tasty meal, but not worth standing in line for.
