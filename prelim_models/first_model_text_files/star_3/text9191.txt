Don't expect great service as this is a no frills type of joint. For nearly the same price as a meal from a fast food joint, you cannot go wrong. Grab yourself a pint of their in-house brews to wash down all the grease from the food! From what I remember, they were only a couple dollars each.

Cheers to a carnivore meal and decent brews!"
