We ordered:

Waikiki burger with waffle fries
Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with crinkle cut fries
BLT with crinkle cut fries
2 sodas
Caramel Frozen Mocha

The food was good, especially for the price. Their waffle fries are delicious! I definitely recommend getting those.

What really was a disappointment was the delivery. The food arrived half an hour late and was semi-cold; this also means my fries were a little soggy as was the bun on my burger. In addition, all the orders came with waffle fries (which wasn't what we ordered). 

Food was good, but the overall experience could have been a little better. I definitely want to come here for breakfast though!!! 



Would I come back here? Yes, but I will not order delivery from them.
Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely, as long as they don't request delivery."
