I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before the lunch rush and was awarded with a table by the door. To make matters worse, the waitress took our orders but forgot to send it to the kitchen. We were waiting 20 minutes for our noodles while the patrons, who arrived later, were enjoying their food. We decided to call a waitress over to ask about our order and were quick to bring us the food with an apology.

The ramen was great with amazing pieces of pork and choice of thick or thin noodles. After being filled up, we were hoping for a discount but were disappointed when none was offered."
