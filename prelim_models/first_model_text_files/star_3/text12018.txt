Again was told 20 minutes. We sat down at the community table and asked to have a table cleaned off in the mean time. The hostess, a young male, had no desire to clean the table. Instead put two tables together. 
The waitress immediately took our drink and food order. She was awesome. The food took 35 minutes to come out. The waffles were so-so, but the chicken was amazing! Would I come back? Yes and be prepared to wait and not order waffles."
