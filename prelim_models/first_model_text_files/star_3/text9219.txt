The prime rib was flavorful and not overly salty, the green beans were hecka tasty (might be some of the best I've had in a long while), and the steak fries were a little too pale for my taste.  The steak and shrimp (~$12) was edible, but definitely not the highlight of my meal.  Standard stuff I get when I go to Denny's or similar establishments.  BTW, the steak special everyone on Yelp raves about was not on the menu - well, at least I didn't see it.

Other important info: The steak and prime rib can be found in the CAFE side and not the BBQ side, the service was too painfully slow (50 mins to get my food), tables are really close together, and apparently they have special root beer which is not listed under their soda section and costs more than soda."
