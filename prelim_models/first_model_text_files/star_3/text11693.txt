My group of four adults and a baby walked in at 10:30am on a Sunday morning, but didn't leave until about 12:30pm. Like at any breakfast place, anywhere, I expected the 30 minute wait to get a table on a weekend morning (especially a Sunday). But what I didn't expect was to wait another 30 minutes for my food to come after I ordered it. One of the best parts about going out for breakfast is how quickly it can be cooked up. It was obvious the kitchen was in the weeds. We could easily see all the runners and servers standing around waiting for orders. And an apologetic waiter could only do so much."
