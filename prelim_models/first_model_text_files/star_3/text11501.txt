Horrible organic soft drinks that we are still wondering who approved release of the gross concoctions from the lab! Stick to the cucumber water. The other choices are $5 OJ or mimosas. To be fair, the pancakes were good. This place has potential with the cool decor and great location. Sad it didn't come through.
