They were both flavourful -but I do have to say that their broth isn't comparable to Santouka or Ramen Isshin's. They also don't have many topping options -no corn!!!! 

The restaurant is small and has limited seating so you do have to split tables with other patrons. Make sure you don't bring a big purse like I did when I went, oops!"
