Unfortunately, all the broths are made with pork. They seemed very surprised by my question so are there not many vegetarians (and muslims also!) in Toronto? 

They didn't really have anything else on the menu so I just got rice and a few of the veggies and did a little DIY on the dinner table. My DIY ended up costing me $15.. lol.. 

The service had some serious language barriers, though they were really sweet. I wish they brought out all the sauces at once instead of each of us having to individually ask and make it more annoying for them too. 

It is a small spot, expect a wait - and outside, but our wait for table for 7 was only 15 min."
