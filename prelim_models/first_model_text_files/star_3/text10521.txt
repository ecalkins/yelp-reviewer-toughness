The service was OK, and the food came out pretty quickly. I had the tonkutsu black, and it was good but not amazing. They were a bit cheap with the overall portion size, but also with the amount of meat and other ingredients. 

I came with a few friends and when one of them asked if they could take their leftovers in a contained they said that they don't allow that... I have heard that doggy bags are uncommon in Japan, but I think this is something Sansotei Ramen should not keep up with because too much food goes to waste! Leftovers are always good for lunch!"
