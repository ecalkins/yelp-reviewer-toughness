I called my order in, I went with the Malibu Beach Turkey Sandwich for $7.75. I was offered my choice of fruit or chips as a side, I went with fruit. 

When I arrived my order was all ready to go, love that I didn't have to wait. The sandwich itself was nothing special though in my opinion, and not really worth the price. The fruit cup was the best part, it came with kiwi, pineapple and melons. 

I may try Beach Cafe again but I'll order a different sandwich."
