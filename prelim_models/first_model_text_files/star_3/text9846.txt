This restaurant has a lot of one-star reviews to say the least and other five star reviews.I was very confused with what to expect but I had to give it a shot.

It's located at a strip mall on East Apache blvd very close to ASU and a bunch of other popular Indian restaurants, they definitely have to put their act together if they want to survive here.

The restaurant was completely empty when we walked in, my order was ready there was only one person who was at the counter he was also taking orders on call.
~Chicken Biriyani $8.99
~Dum ka Chicken $9.99

The Biriyani is hands down a one-star dish, the rice had no flavour and the chicken was overdone to the point of being chewy.It seemed like the biriyani was not fresh and was a mix of biriyani and just plain basmati rice but the Mirchi ka salan and raita were surprisingly good (straight out of a restaurant in India).

The saving grace was the chicken dish, aromatic and full of flavour.The portions are fine and the prices are very competitive.I'm definitely excited to try the other curries on their menu.
However one very bad and another exceptional dish later I have a feeling that they are not quite ready and are still in a trial phase.

Cheers!"
