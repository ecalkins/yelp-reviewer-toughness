20 oz micro beers for $1.75 ...in Vegas.
There, that is it.

The bad: It's dark and creepy, like the downtown Fremont casino's
The staff is always different and never consistent
Day 1 of unknowing experiment: I mosey over to the casino/ restaurant to get my to-go cup of 20oz beverage mentioned above, barkeep fills cup(s), takes money, sends me on my way. I head back to pool where I spend my day lounging and people watching. 
Day 2 of unknowing experiment, I mosey over to casino/restaurant to get my to-go cup of 20oz beverage, barkeep tells me ""We don't serve to-go cups"". 
Roo??
Last 4 weeks I have been served to-go cups, upon which I then retire to the pool across the drive. Barkeep asks other barkeep to confirm. Both barkeeps decide to-go cups must be figment of my imagination, even though EVERYONE in Vegas serves to-go cups.
Then upon further thought, Barkeep 2 tells barkeep 1, there are to-go cups in certain area, if they wish to pour their own.
Whatever. So, they pour large glasses, which I re-pour into to-go cups and now must drink part of both glasses so pour fits in ""too small"", to-go cups. This is disastrous.

The pizza is dry and appears to have been sitting in the window all day. They have a variety of salads, and very inexpensive.

Oh, and reeks of smoke."
