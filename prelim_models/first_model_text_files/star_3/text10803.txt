So I live a few blocks down from Penn and I've walked past this place dozens of times. I was really surprised to read that this place has been reviewed a bunch and seems so established. To be honest, almost every time I walk by the place is empty. And after walking in, even though it's very cool and beautiful on the inside, I got the sense that it was a newer place just starting to get its bearings. This was the case with my stop-in (around 10am on a weekday). The guy behind the counter was helpful and nice. Something that I noticed was a little odd was that he said the cook was out and I'd have to wait if I wanted to get food- so I got a cup of coffee and sat down to work for a bit. The coffee was good, and the Wifi is free and worked perfectly. After a while, the guy behind the counter gave me a menu and even a free refill on coffee while we waited for the cook the arrive. The menu actually looked really tasty, particularly the brunch food (I'm a sucker for breakfast food anytime of the day). I wasn't necessarily stopping in for food, but if I had I would have been frustrated waiting. I finally got up and paid for the coffee and left. I might come back to try the food- and hopefully the cook will be around!
