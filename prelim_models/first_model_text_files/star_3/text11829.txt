Wonderful creative menu but fails on execution. 

English muffin - dense and bitter tasting
Hash browns - not crispy and little seasoning
Scrambled eggs - tastes like some kind of egg substitute
Chicks in a blanket - sausage not a good flavor
Coconut mango crepe - amateur crepe with non ripe mango and coconut thrown in with little thought

Essentially an add-your-own spices kind of place with big enough portions and low enough prices to attract repeat customers. For foodies not so much."
