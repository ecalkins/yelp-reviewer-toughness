Go for the tonkotsu ramen. 

I felt SUPER full after each meal there and to be honest, my stomach didn't feel all that great afterwards but I have a bit of a sensitive stomach to lots of oil and salt, which makes ramen something I should probably stay away from in general. 

The egg is a hit or miss.. the first time I went, it was amaaaazing. nicely cooked outside and a good runny egg yolk inside. I think I sang it's praises to everybody the next day. The second time I went, it was cold, which is a big complaint I had heard from other people. 

The pork is really nicely layered with a thick layer of meat and layer of fat that literally melts in your mouth. 

If you're going as a pair, it's very probably that you'll have to share a table with other people.The place is small, much too small for the number of people who want to eat there so I would suggest going there by 5:30 unless you want to wait outside!"
