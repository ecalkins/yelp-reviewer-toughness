Our order also came out wrong, but we were starving so didn't want to send anything back. The gluten free protein pancakes are delicious. Huge portion, I had them for dinner as well :) You are really packed in  and it's pretty loud so hard to hear what the person across from you is saying. Would I go back - sure. But definitely not one of my favorite breakfast places in the area.
