One of the awesome specials they offered was a steak dinner for 9.99 which included a steak veggies a side salad a potato and a beer (they have a brewery on site). Unfortunately now they stopped giving you a beer with the special. I'm sure if you're still reading this you're probably saying it sounds like a great special even without the beer. And your probably right, but as a patron that's had the special with the beer let me tell you.... it makes a difference. Suddenly this spot has lost some of its appeal. Maybe I'll get over it but as of right now I'm still a little salty. Needless to say I didn't get the steak tonight I had the chicken parm. It was okay nothing to rave about.  I guess this place is still great for cheap food just slightly less great since the change in their specials.
