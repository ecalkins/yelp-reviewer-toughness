I ordered the Shoyu ramen with thick noodles. First thing that surprised me was the small portion for $9.50. It was overpriced, but the meal was ridiculously small. I was still hungry after walking out. 

The ramen itself had a soft and tender pork belly complimented by a salty broth. Although I chose thick noodles, the noodles were very thin and could have fooled me as thin noodles.

It is also worth mentioning that the food came extremely fast but the service felt rushed since they needed to serve the customers outside in the line.

The ramen isn't bad, but in a city with an oversaturation of ramen places to eat at, the line-up and prices don't justify the food."
