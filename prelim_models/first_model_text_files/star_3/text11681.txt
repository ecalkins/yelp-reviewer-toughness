Our waiter, Luke, was competent and friendly.  As we waited for food, I couldn't help but notice large gatherings of servers standing at the food ""window"" waiting for the seemingly missing dishes from their orders.  Plates would appear one at a time, which was odd since the average table size was 4+.  It became obvious that food tickets weren't being completed a ticket at a time, instead, they were batching meals.  

Our appetizer, chocolate covered bacon, came out just before our meals started to be delivered...which took about 20 minutes after ordering.  One side of pancakes (regular) were delivered.  Then, a few minutes later, the second and third side of pancakes (pumpkin cheesecake).  Then, yet another few minutes later, the french toast entree arrived.  It took almost 10 minutes for the omelets to come out.  One side of pancakes never came out, so we got them to go.  

The food was very good!  The kitchen manager was seen speaking very ""animated"" to the waiters and line cooks, which was unprofessional and, from what I could tell, he was the weak link (in the white shirt on the left facing away in the picture).  Ticket times were all over the place, and orders were not being delivered all-at-once. 

The restaurant has been around for 5 weeks, so they should be over growing pains like this.  We will be back for the food, though.

For those complaining about the noise: I feel you.  No carpet, no cushions, all hard surfaces!  

They take reservations, which is good!"
