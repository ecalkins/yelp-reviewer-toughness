My go to at Lo Lo's has always been the soul food platter with catfish, chicken breast, greens and Mac and cheese, tons of food and I usually take quite a bit home.  Sometimes I opt for a veggie plate which is generally a ton of food.  That is until today when I ordered a veggie plate to go.  Four sides and a cornbread $16 out the door.  I've never complained because of the quality as well as quantity.  Today when I picked up my order I thought to myself DAMN that bag seems awful light.  Well it was four 1/2 pint containers about half full...Seriously LoLo's WTF???  And the strings beans and red potatoes side were green beans straight out a can a maybe two pieces of potatoes.  Mac and Cheese has become hit and miss.  Not happy today guys.  You can't get too big, and start screwing things up...I'm sure I'll be back but probably for dine in only.  I feel extremely ripped off today!
