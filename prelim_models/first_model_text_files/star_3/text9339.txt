The singers were awesome, the crowd was fun, but the service was bad! Non-attentive, cared more about talking to the co-worker then with the clients and servicing drinks, not to mention it took over 20 minutes until we actually got a drink. I feel really bad giving this place 3 stars because the Cafe alone deserves 5 stars and the atmosphere of the Karaoke bar should get 4 Stars but because of the bad staff unfortunately I have to give it a 3. I will be going soon to give this place another chance as I believe it definitely has the potential to be a regular spot (for me per say) so maybe (hopefully) this time around they can fully win me over...
