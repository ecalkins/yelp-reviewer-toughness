I ordered the omelette with prosciutto, Swiss chard, mascarpone and one other ingredient. Boyfriend ordered the Dutch apple french toast. We also ordered Bloody Mary's, his was spicy and I ordered mine regular. We also ordered coffee.

The good: quick seating despite how busy it was. The waiter was prompt. The presentation of the drinks was fun-- it came with chocolate covered bacon. Portions were humongous so the ""good"" is that at first you feel you're getting bang for your buck. There was almost no room left on the table to set all the food and drinks. The coffee was satisfactory-- a little stronger/not watered down.

The not-so-good:
My omelette was pretty dry. The ingredients were there, but the mascarpone didn't really shine at all. 

The Dutch apple french toast was just overwhelmingly monstrous. Once you got to the center the intense sweetness calmed down a little, but still really, really heavy. 

The bloody mary was not good. The chocolate on the bacon was overwhelming after a bite. The mix itself was mediocre, and the vodka in it didn't taste all that smooth. It was also $10! I would rather get a $5 bloody mary deal at a sports bar for the taste quality alone! 

The drinks also came to our table spilling over, which I think if I were the business owner I would be concerned about the waste. As a customer, I just didn't like that it soaked the whole napkin coaster. Thanks for filling it to the brim, but I don't want the mess.

Disappointed and would probably have to read more reviews on what people liked, to decide whether it's worth returning to try those things."
