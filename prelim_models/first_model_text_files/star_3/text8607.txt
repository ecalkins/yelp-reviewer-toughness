But you know what, for the price and the way it satisfied my hunger, Ellis Island's ribs blew me away.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the best slab of ribs I've ever had. In fact, it tastes like they actually BOIL the ribs, but once you slather on their tangy bbq sauce, your taste buds will beg for more as you tear into the tender ribs.  Too bad they don't throw the ribs on a grill and glaze some of the sauce on top of the ribs.  That would really take it up a notch.  This place would have received 4 stars if their beer was better, but can I really complain about a 2 dollar beer?  At least they made an attempt to brew it themselves.  Kudos to that.  If I'm craving for cheap ribs again in vegas, I'm comin' here.
