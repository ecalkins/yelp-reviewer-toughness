HOWEVER, I do try to be open-minded and I do try out places for ramen here and there. This is my two cents. Take it or leave it!

Alright, so I heard this was the place that had an amazing reputation for their ramen. Line ups form for this place, how insane is that?! So, I checked this place out with a friend and we had to line up (as expected). Fortunately, the line moved pretty quick. The waiting time was about 10mins (we had at least 5 people in front of us).

I ordered the Tonkatsu Dark ramen with thin noodles. The broth was a bit too salty for my liking however, the pork belly was amazing. It was a good portion for lunch but I don't know about dinner... you'd probably have to order something on the side or add extra noodles to be full. The ramen came pretty quick, so that is a plus for those of you who cannot wait to indulge. 

Aside from the ramen experience, my friend and I had our jackets on the whole time because we were seated right next to the door. It didn'tcome to mind that the door was going to keep opening and closing because of the line up (since eating a bowl of tasting hot ramen was all we thought about). It wasn't the best experience as first-timers here because we were freezing our butts off while enjoying our hot bowl of ramen. We wouldn't mind if the weather was warmer however, we visited on one of the coldest days! 
So, if you're going during the cold season, make sure you don't get seated next to the door. I suggest to wait another 10mins out in the cold for a warmer seat rather than feeling hot and cold during your meal!"
