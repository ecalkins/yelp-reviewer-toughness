Their waffles are incredible! Honestly best I've ever had. We also got the catfish beignets which weren't that special, although I don't like catfish. However the service, as other have said, wasn't good at all. They asked us if we wanted our appetizer first and we said yes, then they brought it to us halfway through our main course. Our waitress didn't refill any drinks, so we actually shared one towards the end. Then they split the check wrong. In the end, if you're okay with meh service the food is honestly worth it.
