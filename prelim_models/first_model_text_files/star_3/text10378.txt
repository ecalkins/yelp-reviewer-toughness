0	"- I have tried tonkotsu black, spicy tan tan, tiramisu daifuku and matcha cheesecake
- Food quality:
       + ramens: the soup was salty, too little of noodles and meat, overall not impressed with their ramen. I prefer kenzo ramen over this place.
       + Tiramisu daifuku: it's tastes more like a chocolate mochi, nothing special. I still think the Lotte mochi selling in korean supermarket are much better and cheaper 
       + Matcha cheesecake: Pretty good actually. I have to say this cheesecake was the highlight of my dinner. It has strong matcha flavour and very well balanced.
- Portion: small, I was not full with one bowl of ramen 
- Price: I thought the price was ok, but the portion was small so I would say it's a bit on the pricey side 
- The place was small, tables are so closed to each other, making it hard to go in and out. 
- Overall, it was not worth the hype at all."
