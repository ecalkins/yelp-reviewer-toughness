Ordered lunch two times and breakfast one time. I can't say I recommend any of the 2 smoothies I've had because they really taste so sweet it's like diabetes in a cup. 

The smoothies: Wipe Out and Jamaican Me Crazy Smoothie. Super sweet. Not advised unless you're a sweets person. 

Grilled chicken sandwich - portion is huge (for me, at least) but it was pretty good. 

Mission Beach Fish Tacos - I wasn't disappointed with these. They were pretty good and definitely filling for me. Managed to even eat all 3 pieces since I don't typically eat a lot in one sitting. 

Breakfast order today: 

Since I'm a bit iffy about their smoothies, I ordered a Frozen Mocha (blended iced espresso, low-fat ice cream, and chocolate). 

Ed's Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Sausage."
