The only reason why I didn't rate this place higher was because of the service. After being seated and our drink orders taken, our waitress did not show up to our table to take our order for almost half an hour. Additionally, when our food was brought out the servers forgot my friend's pancakes and toast. We were also the only table in our section without a water pitcher on our table and my friend had to ask our waitress three times for water until she finally got someone to bring us a pitcher. While we were eating our meal, a server came to our table with a dish that we did not order. I don't necessarily blame our waitress per se because I also work in a restaurant and understand that things get busy sometimes, I believe that this was due to poor and uncoordinated teamwork/communication with the cooks, servers, busboys, and waitress.      

In the end, my friends and I agreed that we would come back and give it another try! We've already kind of decided on what we would like to try next time."
