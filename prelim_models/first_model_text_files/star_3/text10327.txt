Anyways, we braved the cold for this place.  Not too bad on boxing day at dinner.  

Broth is always good and the karaage (they call it something else) is good.  Don't get the Gyoza's.  It's a rip off.

My big complaint?  I saw someone next to us order a green tea muffin.  Ok I want to try new things.  Well...that new thing was expensive.  $4 for a small muffin that was ok in taste.  Service was meh on our way out, no good bye or thank you like everyone else got.

Resist the urge to get the green tea muffin.  Your wallet will thank me later."
