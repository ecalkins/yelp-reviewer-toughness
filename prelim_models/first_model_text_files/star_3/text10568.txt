There was at least a space between us, but a short while later, they seated a total stranger in front of me. Awkward. It was like friends having dinner who couldn't stand talking to each other.

I decided to order the tonkatsu black (garlic) ramen. I thought that the broth was decent. It was just as creamy as other places. However, I thought that the noodles were too chewy. It softened up further as time passed. The egg was not as eggcelent as I would have liked. It was soft in the middle, but at the edges, was a little too cooked. The pork was perfectly tasty, though. So far this is the cheapest ramen restaurant that I've visited in the downtown Toronto area, which may be why it's so popular and I often see long line-ups at night."
