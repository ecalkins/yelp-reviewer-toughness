With that being said, they don't deserve anything more than 3 stars, at this point in time, because their service, wait time, and patio dining, are all subpar.

Service: After coming here 3 times now, I've had to wait 30+ minutes each time for my food to come out of the kitchen. Each time, I had to wait additionally after that for a set of silverware. 

Wait time: It seems that 30 - 40 minutes is typical on a Saturday or Sunday morning here, which is fine for a busy place, so I can't really blame them for. They're just busy.

Patio: It's November, and still fairly hot on their patio. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if they had shade coverings to keep their patrons cool. If you choose to move inside after something has opened up, you may be in jeopardy of losing your food, cause they have trouble keeping track of the table numbers and their patrons.

Overall, I'd still recommend a friend to give it a shot, because their food really is good. Each time I've been here, I leave with a full and satisfied belly. Just frustrated through the process of getting there."
