Way too much food and who takes breakfast leftovers away from a business meeting?!! I would suggest cutting down on the portions and the price (I think it was $13).  The atmosphere reminded me of a camp lunch room with the long tables.  Not a big fan of the cucumber water but they brought me lemon water instead.  Waitress was very nice and prompt.
