They do have your standard sets of bagels, sandwiches, cream cheese, and stuff that you can take to go or eat in, assuming you have the time to sit in & do so (most do not). A suitable option for breakfast and lunch. I would go somewhere else for dinner though since I don't think this place is open during the hours that most would eat dinner at.
