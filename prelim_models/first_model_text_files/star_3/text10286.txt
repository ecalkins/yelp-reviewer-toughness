But what we come for here is the Ramen. While waiting I can see their thin noodles are new, but recommended with the Tonkatsu ramen. I opted not to go with the new ones. Went with original. I don't think the noodles are as good as Kinton.

The broth, it was super pork flavor. If you like pork, you'll like this. If not, you may want to see what other broth they might have.

The ""zangi"", fried chicken was really nice. But way too little.

The eggs in the ramen, really nice. It was two open face eggs soft boiled. You could see the yolk just a bit cooked but for most part drippy. Very nicely done.

I'd come here again."
