The salsa did not impress me. It3 tasted like onions. They were so overpowering I could not taste the other ingredients.
The chips were good. 
I had the Pollo Fundido. They have a different name but they also call it a Fundido in their description. It was good, but nothing special. It had lot of chicken but it was dry. The sauce was very good, but they skimped a little on it. Not good when the chicken is dry. 
I really liked the Spanish rice.

The servers were very attentive. They were training our server, so we had two. 
Drinks were kept filled without even asking (Nice!).
I felt the trainer was a little standoffish when my buddy ordered his taquitos and asked if he could have one beef and one chicken.
She was almost snotty when she told him that to be the same.
I cannot figure out the logic why they couldn't make one each. Does it throw off their inventory that much? Or maybe it confuses the cooks? Still wondering...
Then they put guacamole on them when he was very explicit about NO guac..and he was still nice about it when they put in another order without the guac. The servers were too (prolly because it was their mistake).

I was not impressed with my first visit. But I will give them another chance sometime in the future."
