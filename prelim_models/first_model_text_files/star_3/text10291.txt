I have eaten twice here just to confirm what I felt the first time I came to this place and that's  ... THIS IS NOT THE BEST RAMEN IN TORONTO! 

But if there's one thing that irks me the most about this restaurant,  it's the tiny place. 

You will be eating side by side with a total stranger or even facing someone you don't know.  I had the bad luck of being seated beside a couple. The girl wouldn't stop babbling and lecturing his husband about how many calories there is in a Tonkotsu Black due to the floating garlic oil or how many carbs in a ramen. For heaven's sake, don't you know you're eating in a ramen restaurant, of course there's going to be carbs/calories in there!  

On a good side, the servers are nice and friendly."
