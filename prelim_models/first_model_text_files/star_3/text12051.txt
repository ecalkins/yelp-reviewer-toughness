Now let's talk about the parking.... HORRIBLE. I literally drove around 15min to find a fricken parking stop! There are ""no parking"" signs everywhere due to the hotel that's right next door which makes it so inconvenient. I did see there was valet but really? Why does this place have valet? It makes it so much more frustrating to move around the long lines of cars that are waiting for valet. Maybe if the valet guys weren't standing around chatting there wouldn't be so many cars piling up! Anyways parked at the Bank of America across the street since they were closed today, otherwise who knows where I would've  parked."
