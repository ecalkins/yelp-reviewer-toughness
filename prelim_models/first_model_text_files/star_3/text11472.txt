First off the decor is really nice and clean but yet the staff does match the decor. They all looked VERY sloppy, maybe being new they haven't implemented attire yet? Or a shower for that matter? Sorry they all looked greasy and gross. Service was over the top, almost to much. Couldn't take a full bite without someone interrupting making sure we were okay. Once or twice is good but not every second. Also I like restaurants where you can see the kitchen so I can see the food being prepared, except in this case we were directly facing the kitchen and one guy kept using his hand to wipe his forehead and then was handling the food! Ugh gross!! One out of the 3 chefs touching food was wearing gloves, that reallllllllly bothers me! Gloves should be worn at all times no excuse! Now  to the food, soup was awesome, fries are awesome, but both sandwiches we ordered weren't great. One was the Reuben and we asked what sauce came with it and were told none, then half way through the sandwich we were brought what was suppose to be thousand island and it tasted more like vinegar horseradish. Also the corned beef was not good. Can't remember the name of the other sandwich but couldn't get through that one either. All in all if they clean up in the kitchen (wearing gloves, and not using hands to wipe sweat) I would try this place again seeing the other reviews are good. Gave 3 stars because their new, otherwise would have been 1 or 2."
