I ordered the ultimate oatmeal with the bagel and eggs and potatoes. Someone else ordered the waffle - beach style. It was amazing!!! I had been craving a hot chocolate but figured it was just made out of a packet and didn't want to pay the price of a whole box. 
We paid and when we got home I realized I had left my oatmeal on the counter. We live less than 5 minutes away so we went back to get it and I decided to order the hot chocolate. It was amazing!!!! Got a to go menu and noticed they deliver for free! 
Woke up today and decided to order delivery since it's a gloomy day. I didn't mind the wait even tho I live really close because I knew the food was worth it! Once the food arrived, I was so disappointed. It was lukewarm. Our hot chocolate was not hot and had no extra chocolate or whipped cream. They also forgot the honey for the oatmeal. It just wasn't the same. Probably because it was delivered. I will return to the cafe regardless of today! If I didn't have that experience today I would've given them 5 stars!"
