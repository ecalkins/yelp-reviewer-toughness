I was planning to get a crepe but I saw the spanikopita french toast and knew I had to try it. It was really tasty, and a wonderful combination of flavors. 

Honestly, this may seem like a small grievance but I'm really put off by this: they automatically charge for bottles of water that you don't order. Sure, they're only .50, but I don't buy bottled water and made sure not to drink the teeny tiny bottle that was brought out (before I even arrived while my friend was waiting, no less). It didn't matter, it was on the bill anyway. 

The server brought our check out, and I showed him my coupon for a free coffee upon check in on Yelp. We then gave our cards, but he didn't update the original bill or itemize it per person when he returned; just ran our cards. I think he split it 3 ways evenly instead of by item ordered because my bill was only a few cents cheaper than the others. So, I'm not certain that he took my coffee off my bill or not. Ordinarily, I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but given that they trick each customer into purchasing water that isn't ordered, I'm side-eyeing this place a lot harder than I would normally."
