If you decide to come by during these hours, expect at least a 30 minute standing wait on the sidewalk.

My go-to is the Tonkotsu Black, a pork bone broth made only more awesome by the droplets of dark-hued oil floating on the top, traditionally made by fermenting garlic - though if you're inclined to try and DIY, you'll find methods of making garlic with an oven, saucepan, sous-vide, or even in a rice cooker.

The all-important broth here is OK, it was a super salty when they first opened here a few years ago but have since then improved it by a lot and is now a regular level of ramen salty.  Which is good, because you can choose your noodle thickness, but you can't choose the salt or fattiness level here.

Remember that tea, whether cold or black, will cost you $2.  So when the waitstaff asks if you'd like tea, make sure you realize you're going to pay extra for it.  Cold tea is served unsweetened.

I hear a lot of good things about the green tea muffin dessert from those who have ordered it, but have yet to physically witness someone eating it in-store.  So I can stare at them intensely and watch their reaction.  Hmm, I probably should've kept that creepo comment to myself. ( °  °)

Don't worry, even if you find me weirding you out, you'll probably at least still enjoy your ramen."
