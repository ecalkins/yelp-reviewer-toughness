0	HUGE MENU looks incredible.   I will have to come back and try some other options from the menu.  I had a barbacoa omelette which was okay.  Interesting flavors, but I would not get it twice.  The side of fruit was amazing -- fresh pineapple, strawberries, and other berries were fresh and flavorful.  Loved the presentation of the fruit on a skewer!  Crispy prosciutto was really good.  Corned beef hash was not especially flavorful, so would not get it twice.  Pancakes were amazing and full of sugary flavor.  Coffee was good so I would definitely get it again -- I dont like strong coffee.
