Horrible service, messy floors, over cooked omlettes with barely any ingredients, pancakes delivered twice to our table which we did not order, artwork crooked on the walls, hostesses and servers just standing there and I can keep going...  I even had to point out the syrup on the floor after I watched the server spill it 15 minutes earlier (and yes she knew she spilled it) but never cleaned it up. WHAT HAS HAPPENED?! Open your eyes management and staff, people will start trying US Egg down the road if you don't get back what made you great!
