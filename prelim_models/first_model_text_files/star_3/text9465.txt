The casino is very small.  We came here for the $5 steak and eggs special, but they estimated a 20-25 minute wait.  So to the tables I went.  Standard blakjack, dealer didn't speak much English though.  After losing my buddy's $20 on the first hand (BS... two jacks and dealer shows blackjack :( ) I made $15 for myself (after going down about $30ish).  So after 15 minutes of cards and going through the deck, I went to wait with my group.  After 25 minutes we asked how much longer and they said they had a table of 11 to seat before us.  10 minutes later, they let us in.  Eh.

After being seated, we had a horrible server to start us off.  He walked up to the table and stared at us.  My brother was confused so he asked if the guy was there to take our order.  He answered yes.  So we placed our order and thought that was over.  He then took out jam away, we figured he was refilling it.  Nope.  After waiting another 20ish minutes we got our food.

The food was actually good.  I think it's my favorite $5 steak and eggs place in Vegas so far.  The sirloin was actually OK and the eggs were done right.  The potatoes it came with was the big difference.  It was cubed up and fried like fries.  But it was seasoned really well.

I'd come back here again, maybe.  The service was kinda ridiculous though.  I'd give this a 4 or maybe even a 5 if I had a better experience."
