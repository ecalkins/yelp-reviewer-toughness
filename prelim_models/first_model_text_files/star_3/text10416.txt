0	Was craving ramen on this cold day... being new to this city, I yelped my way over plenty of ramen restaurants and found this one with good ratings.  So I went.  Ordered the black tonkotsu ramen.  It has a garlic oil and that I believed was the black sauce mixed with the broth of the ramen.  I find that black sauce to have a bitter aftertaste.  It is unique but not really to my liking.  For me, it tainted the taste of the ramen broth.  The noodles were very good, it was firm which is the perfect texture.  The chashu was braised really well.  Over all, the ramen was ok.  I just wish the broth was more full bodied and flavorful.
