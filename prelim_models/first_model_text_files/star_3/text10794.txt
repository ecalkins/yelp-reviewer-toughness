But the service would get two stars - and even that might be generous. 

Others have mentioned this, but the waitstaff at this restaurant is so profoundly unfriendly and unwelcoming that we began to wonder if we were on a hidden cam reality show. We walked in and the staff person (possibly the owner, based on comments - a middle aged man with glasses) literally stared and BLINKED at us until he finally said, ""Breakfast?"" Not, welcome....or hello...or anything like that. 

Our waitress in the summer was the same way. No words, no pleasantries, nothing. I don't need anyone to slop on fake pleasantries, but c'mon folks. A few basics, please!

Seriously, we felt as if we were imposing on them by being there. As a native, I know we Pittsburghers can be no-nonsense, blunt, and to the point, but either this place is being run by a staff comprised solely of people who are living with Asperger's, or they're just plain rude and unfriendly."
