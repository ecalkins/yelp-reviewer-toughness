Ellis Island has this not so secret $9.99 steak and beer combo but the only way to redeem this deal is get their player's card and print out the coupon.This coupon is great because it's good for the entire table This meal comes with soup or salad, steak,green beans, a choice of mash potatoes,baked potatoes,or fries,and a choice of their homemade beer or root beer. Also, if your come here for dinner they give you a bread roll for appetizer! The steak is not the best steak but it was fulfilling. I really enjoy the mash potatoes and their root beer is refreshing. I got to try my sister's light ale and was pretty good.  Our server Beco I believe was her name was super helpful and always checking up on us if we needed anything. Overall, for a cheap eat Ellis is a place to try!
