When a sports game  is on in the bar area, they offer 5 wings for $2 and $1 beer. The beer in the restaurant are is still only $2.25. This place actually brews their own beer, so it is not your typical bud or coors for these prices. I love craft beer, so I am probably more critical having tried so many, but I am sure most people would really enjoy the beer here. The flavor and complexity of the beer is nice, but it did seem to be a bit watered down. Maybe to appeal to piss beer^ drinkers? That said, it is still good beer and very drinkable with a large meal.
