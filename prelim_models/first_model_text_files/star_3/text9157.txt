Our hero only got complaints about the food from the party he was with the last time he was here.  It took them almost an hour to get seated on a school night at 8 PM and it smelled awful due to poor ventilation.  It seemed to our hero that they have pretty high staff turnover here because he only recognized one server from the last time he came.

Still... you gotta give it to them that it's quite a good value for the food and most of the beers are still pretty good for two bucks!  Remember, a good rule of thumb for the Ellis Island beers are that the darker they are, the better they taste.

PROS:
- The food's still cheap and filling.
- Some of the lowest limit gambling just a stone's throw away from the strip.

CONS:
- The smokey atmosphere in the casino is nearly suffocating and it permeates into the restaurant.
- Prices have gone up but the quality hasn't.
- Long wait times during dinner."
