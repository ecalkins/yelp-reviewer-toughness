Ellis Island Casino, like its namesake in NY, used to be the place where the weary could hunker down and take some comfort that even with their meager earnings that tomorrow held new and exciting propositions.

Here, gamblers down on their luck rub elbows with families and the elderly looking to score a meal that is recession proof. Unfortunately, the times are a'changin' and the old-school Ellis Island Casino no longer offers what I had considered the best bang for your buck deal in Vegas.

Today, the steak and eggs will cost you $9.99. Not bad at all, just not the screaming deal it used to be. Fond memories of looking at all the food you get and then walking out feeling like you stole something are a thing of the past but I'd still consider coming back to Ellis because the food was good and it still is one of the better cheap options especially late night after clubbing,  gambling, or whatever you did that you want to stay in Vegas. I just wish that good ol' deal had stayed too."
