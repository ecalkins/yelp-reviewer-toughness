However, I have to take off 2 stars because the service at the bar is terrible. I've been here 3 times and always sat at the bar and you never get checked on, you always need to jump and wave to flag down any service, even though the bar tender is right in front of you.

You wait around 15 minutes for a coffee refill. Expect to be there for over 2 hours from start to finish for brunch. Last time I went my plates sat piled up in front of me while I was waiting to check out for over 30 minutes. The servers won't even make eye contact with you so you can get their attention. 

If you get a table, I believe the service is a little better but I have never had such awful service eating at a bar before and this isn't a one time thing."
