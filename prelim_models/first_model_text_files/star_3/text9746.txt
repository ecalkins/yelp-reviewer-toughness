It comes with home fries and the were okay, a little too greasy for my taste, not something I will be getting in the future. They forgot to give my toast which is funny because they gave me plenty of jam. I also order the twisted lemonade and wasn't great, it tasted pretty watered down I'm not sure if that is the regular taste or maybe the ice melted while it was being delivered. They were priced pretty well and the delivery was fast, I will be using them in the future.
