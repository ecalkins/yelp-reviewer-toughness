Midway through my meal an employee came by and was using the other side of my table to count papers and sign paperwork. ???? Umm...I'm traveling, not homeless - go use an empty table, doofus! Didn't enjoy the (white?) soft drink that's on the menu. Not too tasty and don't recommend as a novelty. Wouldn't return again.
