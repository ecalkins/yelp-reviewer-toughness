We came here for the steak and egg special it was $9.99 when we went. There was like a 15 minute wait ! The potatos that came with the meal were tasty and a nice golden brown. The steak was a little too cooked for me. I like my steak to be a little pink inside. 
We almost left without paying because the alarm went off saying to evacuate the building. It was a false alarm though. If you want a break from the prices on the strip this is a decent place to go."
