We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away indoors because there was no more space outside. The menu is plain and simple; they offer several omelettes, crepes, and French toast to choose from. We ordered the Spanikopita French toast (Baby Spinach, Feta, Asiago, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Glaze), mocha French toast, and Swiss omelette. The Spanikopita French toast is the first savory French toast I've ever had and it was pretty good. The mocha French toast and Swiss omelette were unimpressive thoigh. The former was just bread soaked in chocolate with whipped cream on the side and the latter was just your typical omelette (a little dry though). Would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual brunch spot and I can imagine the brick-walled cafe being very cozy in the wintertime.
