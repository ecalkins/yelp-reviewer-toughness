I actually really like the food and vibe. Lots of gaming and such. 
The beer is cheap BUT the beer is also awful; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on National Beer Day. He said it was the worst draft beer he had ever tasted. He even tried a different draft and still was bad. I actually think it is just their brew lines or something that really need to be cleaned, but I don't know enough but beer to judge. 
We left and went to Gordon Biersch that evening. 
We will definitely be back to Ellis Island but only for food, gaming, and cocktails. 
I have heard great things about the pizza place in there. 
Service usually is good but not always."
