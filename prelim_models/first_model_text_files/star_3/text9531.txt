Clearly we weren't the only ones with that idea. It was quite busy with an hour-long wait per person after 10pm when we arrived. Clearly there were many others who were also practicing their audition songs for ""The Voice""

I guess the wait would have been the same at other karaoke bars but I'm not sure. This was the overall best-reviewed so thats why we picked it. The karaoke DJ was friendly, and I loved that he held up a card for ""awesome"" everytime someone had a fantastic performance (loved it when my friend got that card for her's).

Besides that, while waits for drinks were pretty long, I felt that was a given since it was very busy, but each of my drinks was excellent.

Overall, not too bad... only I'm just gonna make sure I'm not going here the next time ""The Voice"" does open-calls in Vegas."
