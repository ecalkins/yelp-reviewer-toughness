I might have a dislike for it because this is the ONLY place my parents wanted to eat at cause it was super cheap, but when I'm on vacay, I want to check out as much as possible.  Nonetheless, I had to be a jerk and tell my parents every time NO and that me and the hubs were gonna go somewhere else.

The one time we did go was after a showing of the Phantom.. I usually don't get too snobby about decor and upkeep in a dive restaurant, but when you go from the gorgeous Venetian to Ellis Island you are going from Ghiradelli to Aldi brand--and man Ellis Island was looking a little on the drab side that evening.

Anyway, lets get back to the food.  I actually didn't want the steak special, but was craving some Italian so I opted for the Chicken Parm -- not only did it come with a side salad, I also got pasta and garlic bread, and I think it was only $6.99.  Glass of wine was CHEAP too, I think $4??  Not the best food or wine around (was actually on the watery side) but what else do you expect with those kind of prices?

Do I think its something to enjoy in Vegas?  Sure, why not?! It's Vegas -- but def look around for other deals too :)"
