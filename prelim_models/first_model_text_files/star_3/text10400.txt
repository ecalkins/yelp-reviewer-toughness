With the ramen selection in Toronto expanding, I think this place is about average. The broth is very good, and you can taste it has been cooked for hours. The egg was just the right amount of tender yolk. The pork was great. Nice and fatty and flavourful. The ramen itself was... meh. It was slightly undercooked and that cut into my overall experience. I got the thick noodles and they should have cooked it for a minute longer. It was slightly hard and chewy. My mom got the thin noodles and it was cooked just about right but there's nothing special to the noodle itself. Honestly I've had better. I'd say it's not worth the trek across town, but worth it if you're in the area and they don't make you stand outside in the freezing cold for a table.
