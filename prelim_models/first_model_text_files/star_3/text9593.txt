I had an omelet and my wife had the breakfast croissant sandwich.  Both were very tasty!.  The service was great  and the food was delivered in a timely manor... but then there were only about 5 customers in the place at 8:30AM... must be an early crowd in this neighborhood.

Ambiance? nothing special...  Its just a diner. Corrugated galvanized metal.  Go here for the food and call it good."
