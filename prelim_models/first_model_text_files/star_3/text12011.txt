I got the Betty's Boob (Chicken breast and a waffle) and a Banana Pudding for dessert.

I'm hoping this way just an off day for the chicken.  Dry and comparable to KFC.  With the reviews I'm reading, I think that's what happened.  

The banana pudding was scrumptious though.

I'll try again, but if the chicken is dry again, that's it."
