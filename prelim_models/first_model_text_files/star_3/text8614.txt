I wish they actually had steak knives. It truly is worth it, and make sure you ask for the draft beer (which by the way only costs $2). I loved going there, but I cannot see myself going there twice like my friend. 

If you are trying to get there by foot, from the Strip, take the Bally's shortcut instead of going around the block. Service is incredibly slow (as they are understaffed). VERY slow. but you get what you pay for in life. 

I feel tempted to give this place 4 stars, but i just think this place is A-OK at a REALLY good value. so 3.5 stars sounds good."
