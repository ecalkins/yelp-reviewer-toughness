First, drink order seemed to confuse the waiter and the bar staff, they were both lost on our mocha, oj, and 2 kids chocolate milk??? ok, is that hard? Geez. Fine, food ordered. Our waiter seemed young and confused (not the best, but he tried I guess). Food took forever due to "" well done skirt steak takes a long time"" umm why? Got the food about 40 mins later and I received a burnt piece of dry thin steak and my 6 yr old received raw burgers. Food got sent back only to receive 1 of 2 burgers raw again, My steak was fixed and much better, however food had no seasoning. Steak, burgers, and hash browns were super bland and cold might I add. Oh and the cherry on top? No AC and no fans on! It was 100+ degrees out. This place has so much potential and I do want to come back. Pancakes and french toast were very good. Staff and cooks need to be improved. Overall meh experience. They did take the kids burgers off the bill, but still doesn't change my review."
