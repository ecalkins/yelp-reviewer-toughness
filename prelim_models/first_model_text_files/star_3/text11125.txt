If you like Garcia's and the like, this place is for you. If you want more authentic Mexican, Don Ruben's is a disappointment. The refried beans were decent, but our shredded beef hard tacos had a hint of fish taste (likely shared the frier with a future fish taco). The Poco Pollo sounded awesome but was super dry and really needed a sauce of some sort.  Our server was attentive and fast (he brought some beans out for our toddler right away), and he was juggling a few large tops. His service was our 3 stars, otherwise, we'd give it two for the food.
