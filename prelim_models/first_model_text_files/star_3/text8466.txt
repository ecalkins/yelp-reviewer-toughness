I ordered my steak medium, and it as definitely overcooked. Everything else seemed fine though (eggs and hash browns.) I also ordered a large glass of orange juice-- which was a whopping $3? My friend ordered country fried steak and it was slobbered with gravy as it should be and but that seemed tastier than my overcooked steak.

Service was terribly slow. I saw a lot of tables left dirty for a long duration before they were cleaned up. I'm sure as a hole-in-the-wall Vegas gem, the hype of this place won't ever go down though."
