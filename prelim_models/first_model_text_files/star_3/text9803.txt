The burgers were pretty good, cooked properly, and the toppings were fresh (no slimy lettuce). They also got the special order correct, having left the tomato off one of the two burgers, which is nice--it's easy to find a place that will add things correctly, but harder to find one that remembers to take them *off*, or at least remember *not* to put them on.
The fries were pretty good; it's hard to entirely gauge the quality of food when it's been delivered after a decent amount of time by a third-party outfit, but we were pleased with our meal and I'd order from this place again."
