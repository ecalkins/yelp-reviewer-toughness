Had the hefe and the amber ale, they were both just okay. The BF kept insisting that the amber ale was stronger than usual, but I think his stomach was just empty.

Around 3pm we got in the restaurant with no wait, but the service was also pretty slow. We wanted to get to the casino!

One roulette ($4 min), one BJ table. Couple variety of slots that weren't bad. They don't give you your $10 in free play until 24 hrs later, forcing you to return. Also, ""5x"" points is really the lowest denominator of points since they have 5-12x points everyday of the week. Meh."
