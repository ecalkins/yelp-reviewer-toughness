Nestled inside of one of Las Vegas's notorious strip malls right between a gas station and bar, this nifty little eatery was a decent find.

The service standards in this town have declined so poorly that most dining experiences are a let down when it comes to great customer service. With that being said, the service at Beach Cafe was just that: mediocre.

The name of the restaurant, Beach Cafe, is exactly what it is: an island themed eatery complete with bathing suits hanging from the ceiling. 

Our very friendly waitress (insert sarcasm here) took our orders and shortly thereafter our food and beverages arrived.  My eggs, potato's and pancakes were delicious, and the orange juice and coffee weren't bad either.  But if you're super thirsty you might be waiting a while for a refill, if you are even asked if you'd like a refill at all. 

I love the idea of supporting local businesses so I would most certainly eat at Beach Cafe again should I end up in that area.  Though the service was not spectacular (the norm for most establishments these days), it's fine eats for breakfast!"
