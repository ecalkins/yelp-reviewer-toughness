ordered Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, Miso Ramen and Gyoza. one thick nooddle and one original. I liked the thick noodle, it's more chewy. 

Soup base tasted almost the same between the two ramens. I liked the creamy soup but it was too salty and the meat was too fat... also, their portion is on a smaller side compare to other ramen places. 

Gyoza was just a soso, nothing impressive about it really and i think the 4.50 price is too much for 4 pieces."
