I had 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes and 2 pieces of toast for $3.99. Not only was it cheap but you get 4 pieces of big bacon!! Soooooo much of deal it's hard to imagine!

If you're an outdoor lover... or if you're aching to see something besides the inside of a casino, don't come here.

Otherwise, this is  great cheap breakfast that will fill you up and put you back to bed."
