I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was a pork chop cullet covered in white gravy sauce and it came with a side of their ""famous"" green beans. My meal also came with a baked potato. Mmmmm.. For $8.99, I was really satisfied with the food. However, there were a few bites of the pork chop cutlet that was really salty. 

The rest of my party all ordered the top sirloin 24/7 breakfast plate. It came with the obvious top sirloin, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, and toast for $10.99. They all ordered it medium rare, however, when the food came out, all their meat was cooked differently. The consistency in food quality was not there. 

Food: 3 stars
Service: 4 stars"
