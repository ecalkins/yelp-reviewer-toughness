0	New place my daughter and I decided to try for lunch.  Upon entering, we immediately noticed the noise level was very high.  I ordered the traditional eggs benedict, my kid ordered the Shea panini.  My Benedict was meh---eggs were overcooked, muffin mushy, and barely a teaspoon of hollandaise.  My daughter loved her sandwich, however, which was pretty and huge. Service was fine, within 15 minutes of ordering, except I would have liked my coffee refreshed.  Manager came to our table and I told him nicely and politely about the Benedict.  He apologized profusely and offered a dessert or a coffee to go and overall could not have been nicer.  I will wait a while and then give Eggstasy another try.
