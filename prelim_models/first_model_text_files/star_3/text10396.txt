4 stars for food, 3 for the lack of logic and reason haha.

This is even hotter and smaller than the other end of the street by Bond Place hotel.  Probably the booths in the back has something to do with this.  Their sharing seating arrangement very Asian style, 2 different pairs of strangers can share a 4 -seater, I like that as long as you don't bump into your ex.

So ordered the Tontaksu, with thick noodles, good pieces of cha sew, and black fungus, so broth is great.  Comes with a half-cooked egg so I asked server if I could get more noodles or meat in lieu of that, as my tummy doesn't sit well with the egg...

Well, you know how the story ends.

Good but not great.  Back home, we have way more toppings like roasted garlic chips, corn, etc.

Show you around :)

I do not understand since I'm saving them $  from the egg, nor am I asking for a discount...and it is not like I'm asking them to make me a new dish like some customers with food allergy issues.

And my ginger ale, was virtually gasless or non-carbonated."
