The wait wasn't too long which was nice, the bloody mary with the chocolate covered bacon was interesting and tasty, and our server (tall, light brownish hair) was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend isn't picky with food and enjoyed his although admitted it wasn't the best.. he had some type of omelet. I had the salmon benedict. GROSS!! And I loooveee salmon with a passion and honestly had never tried a salmon I didn't like until we came in this morning. It either tasted way too salty or just too ""fishy."" Was it a bad batch? Or do people actually like it to taste like that? I may never know, but I couldn't even finish it. We love other breakfast places and will probably just go there instead."
