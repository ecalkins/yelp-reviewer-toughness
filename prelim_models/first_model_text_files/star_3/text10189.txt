Soup base was good...I had the spicy one. But for the price you pay you would think they would give at least 2 pieces of meat/pork belly. 

My wife had the other soup which was just okay...maybe because I had the spicy one first that this tasted just okay.

On a cold winter day this would a welcoming treat but need more meat."
