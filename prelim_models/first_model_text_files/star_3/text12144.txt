Forced use of valet parking was the first bad sign. You either valet or, like us, park across the street and walk. All other spaces are reserved for hotel guests. The restaurant was busy and very loud. We were seated and placed our order for both drinks (including water--it was a hot afternoon) and food fairly quickly, but had to wait a good 15 minutes before we got the drinks. When we did we got three of our drinks in the large mason jars and one in a small one with no waters...they apparently ran out of clean glasses. After another 20 plus minutes we finally get the water and another 20 before we got our food. No check ins from our waitress no refills. It wasn't just us--the table next to us was waiting for a takeout order and there was some issue addressed with the manager. I was going to mention our poor service to him but he disappeared. We love LoLos but will try the Gilbert location or go downtown before going back to Scottsdale,
