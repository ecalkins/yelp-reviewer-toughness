Pro: Friendly staff, great karaoke atmosphere, cheap drinks.

Con: The MC clearly plays favorites to locals and coworkers. She will tell you that ""you can not tip your way to the front of the line and everyone must wait their turn"", but then she'll let 80 year old Elvis sing 2 songs within a half hour and then the 60 year old Elvis gets 2 songs.

I've visited this bar 5 times within the past 3 years (every time I go to Vegas) and this has held true during all of my visits. Coworkers will also get to jump the line and sing multiple songs while out of towners have to wait about 1-2 hours per song. 

I look forward to visiting Ellis Island for karaoke, but I don't think its fair how the singing order is dictated by the MC. ARRIVE EARLY and good luck if you plan on singing more than 1 song. You will be there until they close waiting for your second song to come on. Dress like Elvis; you'll have better odds of getting to your second song."
