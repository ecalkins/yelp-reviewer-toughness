However, you're in vegas so the amount you pay for said steak is probably less than your minimum pass line bet at the craps tables. In many cases it's 1/3 your minimum bet. That's pretty damn bad ass. 

The lighting hurt my head, the smell hurt my head, the A1 sauce i smothered my steak in to mask the actual flavor of the meat hurt my head, body, and emotional disposition. For actual food, 2 stars. For price and value, 4. Average of 3 starz 4 u hoes"
