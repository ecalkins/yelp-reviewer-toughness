Noodles were undercooked so it was hard and stiff. Egg was also under cooked, soft but egg yolk was still too raw; yolk was leaking everywhere into the broth. Miso ramen broth was so salty I ended up drinking 2-3 cups of water. Green tea cheesecake needs more green tea taste. It's a small little restaurant with waiting line, but you have to wait outside.
