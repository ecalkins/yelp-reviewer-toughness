I went there at Monday afternoon with a friend. We ordered a seaweed salad,a Tonkatsu ramen and  a black one which add black garlic oil making the dish more delicious. The thickness of the noodle can be chosen by yourself but actually not very different. The soup was a little salty and vegetables were too less. The seaweed salad was great but I can buy a party size of it with same price .

The atmosphere was not bad for meal and I dislike the spoon.. It needs a try but only once. There are many ramen with better flavor in Toronto I think."
