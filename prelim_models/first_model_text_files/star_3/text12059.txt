They are located right next door to Holiday Inn Express, and I really enjoyed dinning outdoor, with plenty of spaces to hangout with your buddies. Their indoor/outdoor bar area is pretty ingenious. I can imagine this place getting very packed, but the nice thing is that the tables are far part and don't feel so cramp.  Love their high back booth too. Very ""sheeky!!""  

Until then, Cheers ~ :p"
