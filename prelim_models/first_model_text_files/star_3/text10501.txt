Environment is nice, feel clean, comfortable seating with Japanese decorations. Service is good, staff are nice and polite.

I tried the black tonkotsu with thin noodles. It comes with 2 thick slices of pork and 2 half cooked cold egg slices. I've tried some ramen in Osaka, Japan, standard ramen over there comes with 3 thin slices of pork which is nicer in texture. I don't enjoy the pork texture here. 

Soup taste good at first, and then the more I eat the more salty and thirsty I feel, I suspect it's because of the MSG. 

Noodle is hard in texture, there's a difference with al dente and it's not, it's just hard. 

Overall the bowl of noodle is an acceptable lunch but doesn't worth it in this price. And I definitely won't have it as dinner."
