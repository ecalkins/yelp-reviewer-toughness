I loved the bright indoor/outdoor space and the modern details. Our waiter was very friendly and was clearly trying hard, but the whole staff seemed to struggle with the volume of customers. The kitchen timing was way off - for example, all of our dishes came out as once except for one, which took more than a half hour to arrive after everything else. At one point, a second waiter brought over some plates. We started explaining what went where when he rolled his eyes, slammed our plates on the table and said, ""I'm too busy,"" before running off. It was so inexplicably rude. At the end of the meal, our waiter kindly explained he hadn't charged us for our coffee, but ""didn't hear"" when we responded that we had purchased our coffees at the car prior to being seated. I would probably go back for the food, but I will expect to have a long wait and potentially rude service."
