Not many choices here, I think there were 4 or 5 choices coming with sides you either ate or didn't but that's what you got. 

Ordered the combo plate, half a chicken and half rack. 
The bbq sauce was very good (and I don't like bbq sauce) the bbq beans were good (and I don't like bbq beans.) 

Only regret was I should have ordered the ""full rack"""
