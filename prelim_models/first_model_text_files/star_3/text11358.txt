To me, this place is OK, I can't say I was impressed with the food.  The ambiance  was nice though, it was well decorated and had a lively atmosphere.  The service was good and they constantly fill up your water and coffee.  The place had a diverse menu alot of variety.  As you may know, I'm not a sweets person and not a huge fan of waffles, pancakes, or crepes, which this place is know for.  I'm more of a biscuits and gravy guy or meals that are hearty.  I ordered the brisket and gravy, but was eventually told they ran out of brisket, so I went with the standard biscuits and gravy and two eggs.  I also ordered the chrizo  cheddar grits.  The biscuits were whole and had gravy on top.  It didnt have enough gravy for the whole dish.  I felt the dish was very dry and bland.  The cheddar grits were nothing to rave about either and for the price, the portions were small. 

If you ask my fiancee she would give this place 5 stars.  She's into the fancy fresh juices and presentation.  I'm all about the food.  I was told they have big portions, but it was nothing to rave about.  I did see an omelette dish the person ordered next to us, it did look good.  Anyways, I'm always open to try out breakfast joints, but I dont think I would go back to this place again...Who am I kidding..my lady loves this place, I'm sure I'll be back and hopefully will try something better and give it a better review."
