I've never tried the food here, and quite frankly, after the health dept. came in and had a few choice words, I'm not sure I want to try it anytime soon. 

They have basic table games--blackjack, dice, and roulette. The gambling is always fun with super cheap minimums (and also very low maximums). There are plenty of slot machines for the homeless to blow an entire day's worth of begging on which definitely happens on a daily basis here. 

What you should take away from this review: If you're looking for concrete floors and cheap booze, stop searchin'."
