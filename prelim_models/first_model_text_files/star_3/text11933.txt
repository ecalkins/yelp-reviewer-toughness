It has a new, fresh look with a fun Southern feel (even have a DJ), but the menu is where Lo-Los falls short. The prices are too high for the tastiness of the food. I ordered a side of cole slaw for $4 and the portion was smaller than expected and tasted like nothing more than shredded cabbage tossed in miracle whip. The house fries are incredible; mine were perfectly cooked. The food was good, but definitely not great. Fun place to try but not somewhere I'd return to again and again.
