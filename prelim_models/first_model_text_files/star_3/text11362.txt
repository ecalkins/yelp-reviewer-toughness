However, I would say the food was just average - we all got different items and none of them stood out. The corn beef hash could have come from a can, the croque madame needed way more bechemal for the mountain of bread, the bene was fine and the eggs OK. THe standout was the bacon which was fantastic overall - I would come back to try the chocolate bacon but that would be it.

Definitely better options for bfast in the area but not a bad spot by any means."
