I got a simple breakfast 2 eggs, home fries and sausage (3 sausages) & toast $5.99, my husband got the steak and eggs special 10 oz steak, 2 eggs and home fries & toast $6.99. We enjoyed everything except the home fries, they were overcooked and crispy (not my thing). Service was slow although they were very busy so that's forgivable. I would recommend Ellis Island.
FYI  the breakfast steak special price is $6.99 before 11:00am $10.99 after 11:00."
