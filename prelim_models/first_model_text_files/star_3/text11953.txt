If you need to park, you're forced to use the valet.  I mean hardly anybody is going to the hotel.  It's complimentary valet, but you will feel bad not to tip and the parking is in the front of the restaurant but they blocked it for valet only.

Needless to say we left...too bad the food is really good especially my favorite, Collard Greens."
