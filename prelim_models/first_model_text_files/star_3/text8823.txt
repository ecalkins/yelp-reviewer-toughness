For some reason she thought it was ok to tip herself with our change, she would keep at least a dollar for herself instead of allowing us to tip her. . . and she was over charging us for our drinks. . . like seriously overcharging. We finally got it figured out with the bartender who happily refunded our money, and we just started giving our waitress exact change for our drinks. 
The KJ on the weekdays needs an attitude adjustment too. . . He has favorites that he lets sing over and over again, yet the new people or people that don't go 3 times a week aren't even given a chance. 
The rest of the casino is nothing to really get excited about. . . although from my experience most of the bartenders are really cool. 
Overall. . . if you go to karaoke on the weekends or just stick to the bar you should have a pretty good time"
