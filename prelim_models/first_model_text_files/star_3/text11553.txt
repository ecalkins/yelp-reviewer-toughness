The whole place was a bit chaotic.  We placed our order and my wife ordered a bloody mary...they were $10.  The waitress dropped the bacon that came with the drink...not a big deal...but then did not even attempt to bring her a new piece.  After asking the waitress to, she did.  The portion sizes are HUGE!!  (see my pictures)  The prices were good too.  Plenty of positives with the place, but overall the whole experience was mediocre at best.  Not sure I would return.
