I asked 3 different people to bring water for hubby and I (we were the last in our group to arrive) and we wound up with one water glass. However, they were quick to bring refills of chips and salsa, and checked on us frequently throughout the meal. The water glasses may have been a fluke because it was a pretty crowded table and we didn't have any other issues with the service.
The food was decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. Yeah, I know it is Mexican and I'm a wimp. No one else seemed to mind, so take that with a grain of salt. It did seem to sit a bit lighter than most Mexican food, so that was good. The margaritas were STRONG and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us."
