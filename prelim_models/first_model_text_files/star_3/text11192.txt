I don't think this is the cheese that's typically put on tacos. The cheese is usually white, not yellow. This made it more Americanized imo. I asked for a spicier sauce to go with it and was surprised the green sauce was the spiciest because it wasn't spicy at all. They offered tobasco, but that doesn't go well with tacos; to me at least. The rice was very soft and went well with the entree. The bean soup was pretty good. I feel like there's way too many Mexican restaurants in the area for them to be priced so high.
