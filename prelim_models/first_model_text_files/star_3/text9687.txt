Not one of the bad reviews has a response from the owner. That isn't good. 

I have ordered from here about 10 times using amazon delivery and most the time the food is decent. Amazon service is good but the food prep was lacking sometimes. 

Fruit was small, didn't seem very fresh, and gave a lot of hard pieces of melon. They should use something to wrap the breakfast sandwich to hold the stuff in place because sometimes the cheese is only covering half and stuff was falling out.

The other thing is they send advertising for grubhub when I ordered on amazon. Showing total disrespect to the company that brought you the 10+ orders I've gave you just shows again the disrespect they have for others. 

I wanted to give at least a 4 but I know my concerns will go ignored like the other reviewers. 

Step it up Beach."
