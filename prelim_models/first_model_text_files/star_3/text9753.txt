(These were all half sandwiches) I could taste a hint of horseradish it was tasty but a little salty. I also had their Bow tie Pasta with Alfredo sauce that had little bits of corn in it. It was yummy. Their was an amazing looking dessert plate with brownies, little cookies...BIG cookies with cream in the middle. I just had a tiny shortbread cookie drizzled with chocolate. It was good... the consistency reminded me of a Mexican Wedding Cookie. I only took one cookie because I thought I would have time to go back but It was too busy. One of my cubicle mates was raving about their wraps ..saying it's the best wrap she's ever tasted. She was like , ""Why don't you get one ? "" I told her I already chose my sandwich...she was like, ""So get another one"". I told her I didn't feel like getting hijacked up there because I went to get seconds. (It was still early and not everyone had a chance to eat yet) My other neighbor offered to give me hers because she doesn't eat sandwiches. So she gets me this Chinese Wrap (we didn't know the wrap my co worker was raving about was the Southwest Wrap) The Chinese Chicken Wrap had chicken, celery, carrots and those crunchy noodles you usually put on top of salad. It was spicy yet too salty for me ..I'm super sensitive when it comes to salt. I was so full by the end of the day but before I go home Sharr E brings me another Chinese Wrap not knowing I already had one. (My co workers are so caring!) Needless to say I couldn't eat another bite !"
