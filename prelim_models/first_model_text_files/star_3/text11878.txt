Since we had never been there before we decided to go with 2 completely different meals. She went with the chicken & waffles I chose Burger & fries. Server was very friendly & knowledgeable. When food arrived, burger was good & chicken was ok, not something I would wake up on the weekend & make a point to go out of my way or change my plans to get to. A little pricey for the meal but trying it for the first time ok. This is where it gets interesting. If you go Do Not, I repeat Do Not park on your own.  They share the parking lot with the Holiday Inn next door & neither business is sure who owns what as far as the parking arangment goes. You will be towed ($125) & on your own to get your car back. The food is good but the parking arrangment leaves a lot to be desired. They offer valet, but no one will stop you and tell you the difference until it is way to late. Needless to say we will not being going back.
