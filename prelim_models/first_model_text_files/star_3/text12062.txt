Service? Eh. There were plenty of seats available, yet we had to wait for a seat. Understaffed? Doubt it.

Our waitress (don't remember her name) took a while to come to our table. She asked for our order, and never came back. And I mean -- never. Someone else brought our waters. An hour rolls around... No food. We flagged our waitress down, and she went to check on them. On her way back, she noted ""I DID PUT YOUR ORDER IN WHEN YOU ORDERED, BUT IT'S NOT READY YET."" Mhmmm... Seriously? It does not take an HOUR to fry up some chicken and waffles. In a not-so-filled restaurant. We gave them 10 minutes to bring our food, or we're leaving. No food, she didn't even bother making eye contact with us, and plenty of larger parties who were seated AFTER us received their food. So, as rude as this may sound, we got up and left.

Also, I don't understand why this place needs valet. Although complimentary, I'm pretty sure I am capable of parking my own car. They lost the keys to our car, and our car was also nowhere to be found in the parking lot. 

As much as we love Lo Lo's...this location lost our business."
