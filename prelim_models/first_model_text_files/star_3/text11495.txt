I ordered the gypsy skillet and my daughters order French toast with bacon and a scramble with mushrooms bacon cheese and avocado. The later was a special order bc they didn't have exactly what my daughter wanted. They had no problem accommodating us. Very nice. Once we ordered we started to wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. The food took a long time to come out. Another two tables got their food before us even though we had ordered first. When our food finally came, thank goodness, it was yummy. The gypsy skillet is delicious and the skirt steak is tender and cook perfectly. Both my daughters were happy with their food also. So even though we waited a long time for our food, it ended being good. We will try this place again. I am giving it three stars because of the long wait for our food.
