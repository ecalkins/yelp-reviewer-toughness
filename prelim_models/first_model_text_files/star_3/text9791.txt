Most of the time I order fish and chips and this time it was a little disappointing.   The fish was really small this time it was equivalent to 2 pieces like before.  I never had the greatest service here before and this time was the absolute worse.  It seems like they don't know how to prioritize customers and instead favoritize them.   I get that it's a ""beach cafe"" but don't take the full beach mood to the max.  They seemed very laxed when it came to serving people and answering the phone.  They said they'll bring the condiments over but completely forget and never refilled our drinks.  I suggest go at your own risk if you want mediocre food and no service."
