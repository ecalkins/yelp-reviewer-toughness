Tip: Best time to go during lunch time is between 11:35-11:45 a.m.- if you go after noon,  you will be waiting OUTSIDE in the cold. 

I always get the Tonkotsu ramen but today I tried the 'spicy tantan' ramen as there's only limited quantity available (sounds exclusive). The server recommended thick noodle so I went with her recommendation. Spicy tantan has pork belly, ground pork, bean sprout, bamboo shoot, egg and green onion. It was quite salty for my taste and there was not enough veggies- I found one bamboo shoot and 2-3 bean sprouts. Noodle was perfectly cooked though. Overall, spicy tantan ramen was A-OK. I prefer Tonkotsu ramen as it never disappoints."
