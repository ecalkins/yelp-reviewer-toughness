It turned out to be somewhat worth it in the end, but I didn't really appreciate the incredibly damp beginning.

The second time I came here was with a friend on a sunny day, after an hour or so of skating at Nathan Phillips Square. This was the only popular ramen joint I knew in the area, and had tried before, so we shuffled over in the cold for a bowl of hot Tonkotsu Black ramen. 
I am a huge lover of garlic, and so I was only a little taken aback by the pungent garlic in this ramen. The meat was great, the noodles were good, and the broth was okay, but it was all incredibly salty, especially as you neared the end of the bowl. 

The service is mildly attentive, and the only downside to a restaurant smack in the downtown core like this one was the fact that it's basically a glorified hallway. I really don't understand the huge hype over this restaurant, however, as it doesn't have many options, nor is it very memorable. I believe the wait times for this place can simply be attributed to the tiny amount of seating they actually do have, which is cozy but can sometimes get awkward when someone's watching anime on an iPad one seat away from you without any earphones in.

tl;dr: If you're a ramen enthusiast, check this one out. It's not on my faves list, as I favour Ajisen over it, but it's of reasonable quality and worth a try after a visit to Eaton's or the like."
