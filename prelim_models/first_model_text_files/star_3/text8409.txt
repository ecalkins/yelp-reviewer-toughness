People singing great songs and dancing their booties off but the hotel was old and very run down. On the brighter note, the food was great and the prices were very cheap. If you're visiting Las Vegas and you're on a budget, I'd stay here for 2 reasons.. 1 being the food and the cost of the hotel and 2 being the after hours karaoke joint.
