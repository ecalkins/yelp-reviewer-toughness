The food was good but not great. The Amber brewed beer was very good. 
Service was lacking. Drinks took a long time after we'd sat down. They were very large cups so we didn't need refills. 
Pricing wasn't too bad. 
For as much positive feedback I read on Yelp! before  going really disappointed me."
