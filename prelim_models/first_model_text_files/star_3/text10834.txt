Breakfast is without a doubt the most important meal out of any. This being said, the varieties in breakfast fare from culinary adventurous, to hip and chic, to greasy spoon leave a diversity in the class of breakfast and brunch themed resteraunts or events.

To me, it is like Best Picture overall, Foreign Language film of the year, or Best RomComnotstarringSethRoganOrBradleyCooper.

Caffe Monna is its own niche. They can really develop this into something fantastic with their real estate. They have a quaint inside, and sidewalk seating. The outside porch is magnificent. Kudos for outside spaces that make our flighty Pgh sunny days all the more wonderful.

CM has a hipsterish vibe, and there is nothing wrong with that. Their menu is succinct and their coffee mugs large. The prixe fix menu is very reasonable on price, as are most of their options. They could use a few more meat and taters options though, as potatoes, to me, are the hallmark of a good brunch.

I ordered the Elvis Crepe and my girlfriend ordered the French toast. My crepe was somewhat dull and had too much peanut butter. The simplicity that is a perfect crepe was betrayed by the lack of balance in the ingredients. A crepe with bacon, bananas and peanut butter can be made a lot more interesting. The PB should be a very delicate spread though.

My girlfriends french toast with fig preserve and brie was quite good. The fig preserve could have been made better as a fig syrup.

If CM steps their culinary game up just a tad, they could be a repeat spot pretty easily. I don't think this would take too much on their part."
