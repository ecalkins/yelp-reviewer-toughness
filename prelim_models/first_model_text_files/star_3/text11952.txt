The food is very good - so good I'd probably put up with the annoyances again. 

Cons: 
I'm seeing this in a lot of reviews about this place - the service is kinda slow. After we were seated, no one talked to us for 15 minutes or so. A nice woman (manager? owner?) came over and asked if anyone was helping us. I said no, and a server showed up after another 5 minutes or so. It was busy, but not crazy-busy. The time between when we were seated and when we got food was about an hour. 

The interior of the new location is beautiful, but it's really hard to have a conversation because it's loud and everything echoes off the hard brick, concrete and glass surfaces. The old location was nice and basic, a good place to hang out with friends and fam. The new place is a good place to sit and yell at each other, and smile and nod when you can't hear their response. ""This place is great."" ""WHAT?"" 'I SAID THIS PLACE IS GREAT."" (smile, nod...) ""yeah"" ""WHAT?"" ""YEAH!"" They need some kind of sound control in there. I'm not saying it should be like a library, but I would like to be able to have a conversation. 

Valet parking. Ugh. It is ""complimentary"" but I feel like a cheap jerk if I don't tip the guy for bringing my car from 50 feet away. Wouldn't it just be faster / easier for me to walk the 50 feet and get my own car?

I'm conflicted. I still love the food, but Lolo's has gone from being a simple, friendly place with great food to just another trendy, annoying Scottsdale hangout. That's progress I guess."
