Took off stars because it doesn't matter how cold it is outside, even if it's just the 2 of you waiting, they make you wait outside. Every time the door is opened,  cold draft comes in. Can't enjoy a ramen without wearing a jacket. Other Japanese places would have placed a temporary stormdoors/porch to let customers wait and prevent the draft from entering."
