We ordered the shoyu ($9.50), the spicy tantan ($9.60) and the zangi/fried chicken ($4.50). 

Service was quick so we got our bowls almost right away.  Tasty but super salty broth and portions a bit on the small size for the price.  I definitely could have used more food and I'm not a big eater.

Was looking for the $12 ramen+beer combo but didn't see it on the menu or on any signage.  Guess that promotion has passed?

Ramen places are so abundant in Toronto now so I'm likely to go to a few other places before returning to Sansotei."
