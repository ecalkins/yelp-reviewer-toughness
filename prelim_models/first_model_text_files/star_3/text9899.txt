The place is quite small and may fit only 20 ppl at best...We were sitting at the very front like the poster child for this joint. We ordered two Tonkotsu with extra noodles (thin + thick), chasu, and eggs. 

The broth is a tad salty for my gf, but its not bad. Better than instant noodle broth for sure. The noodles we preferred was the thin noodles. The chasu was quite fatty for those that enjoy that, but definitely had better chasu elsewhere like Ajisan. The egg was cooked almost fully with a bit of ooze on the inside yolk. The soup came with some black fungus and scallions.

For two people, the bill added up quickly to $30 before tips. This was an experience, and we would probably try other ramen place to find our niche."
