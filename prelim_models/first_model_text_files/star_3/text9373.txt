The major disappoint came when I asked for a substitute for the fries and was told there are NO substitutions, period, end of subject. I asked for the steak sandwich to be then served without the bread and hold the fries. I was told they won't do that, I can take them off myself. No separate checks either and do not even try to split the bill between two cards, NOT ALLOWED!
