We eagerly awaited the opening of the Gilbert location and finally made it down. What an utter disappointment. The wait staff was so rude and seemed to hate being there. Our server was polite, but not completely competent. Even Maurice didn't seem comfortable and relaxed here. As a person of color with an advanced degree, I enjoy eating in a variety of restaurants. However, minority owned and operated restaurants have my heart. Good food aside, that's why I love Lolo's; it reminds me of the soul food places I ate at back home in L.A. The Gilbert location is very gentrified and so Gilbert-washed with its
customers dressed like slobs (just like they do elsewhere in town) griping about the Gospel music, and its weird chicken art, there is nothing distinguishing Lolo's from any other restaurant on the block. I won't be back. I live near Florence and it's about 90 minutes each way to drive to their location on Central. That's where I will go to enjoy my chicken and waffles with customers who dress (YEAH we DRESS the f--- up!!!) to eat out and chill while watching Soul Train or listening to their sick DJ on Saturday night. 
As my poor white boy husband who grew up on Chicago's south side remarked, ""It's like they white washed it, if that makes sense."""
