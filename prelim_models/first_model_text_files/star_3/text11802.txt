The omelet I ordered had great filling, but way too many (overcooked, rubbery, greenish) eggs surrounding the good stuff.  My boyfriend had some decadent stuffed french toast and he was happy in sugar high heaven.  We also ordered coffee and bacon, as those are our litmus test items for breakfast places.  The coffee was just ok and the bacon was decent.  The restaurant itself was clean, bright, and had a good vibe (very friendly wait staff).  I did note that the main dining area was really noisy.  Definitely won't be bringing Grandpa here.  Huh? What?  Never mind.  Overall, *shrug* - we're 50/50 on this place.
