We weren't going to say anything until 3 tables that came as long as 20 mins after us were getting their food already. We brought it to the managers attention and he let us know our order was placed 10 mins ago. It was pretty upsetting to hear that we sat over 30 mins until our order was put it. He took care of most of our meal which was great and the food was good and hot but lost our appetite by the time the food came out.
