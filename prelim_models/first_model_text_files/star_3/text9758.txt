I had fav servers who I don't see any longer. The delivery is now atrocious. It takes forever to get your food. It comes cold. The blonde lady behind the counter who never does anything or talks to customers, I can only assume she is an owner or manager, she is RUDE.  She's rude when you call, and she's rude if you come to pick up food.
