If you're lucky enough to go when one of the three tables or few bar stools are free, this would be a nice little place to do some work. However, if it's any type of busy at all, I could see longer waits and the need to take your coffee to-go.

The coffee itself - I got a black drip - was nothing special. It tasted fairly watery, and didn't have any real tasting notes. However, the barista was friendly, and I think it's great that Redhawk is trying to stake out its place amongst the many corporate shops in Oakland. I'll probably try it again in the future to see if maybe it was just a bad brew day (especially since there's so many other reviews saying it's great), or to try a latte."
