I ordered the 10oz. top sirloin special. It comes with a nice serving of green beans, a choice of potato, dinner roll, a few packs of saltine crackers, and choice of soup or salad, and 20 oz of ""Beer"", if you are not into alcohol, then they have Root Beer.

They advertised that it came with a broccoli spear, but my plate was missing it.

I ordered the steak to be ""Medium-Well"", it came out barely cooked enough to be called rare. I sent it back, and it came back medium. I think their roaster is too hot, because there was a nice and good char on the outside, but the heat doesn't get to the center.

The potato was also quite a bit hard, which is an indication of under-doneness.

This is a very good value.

The server was nice and friendly."
