The owner, Joe(?), is very accommodating and understands what it means to have a new concept in Scottsdale restaurants. Unfortunately, he needs better staff. Being from the east coast I often criticize how customer service is a dying breed but maybe it's simply because I'm more towards the west coast and everyone is just used to giving only 60%. I rarely witness Quick To Serve experiences. This place is one of them. The hostesses will be two young girls looking around not knowing what tables are available while what appeared to be Joe's mother yelling at them in a thick foreign accent and they just don't even budge. Our sever was awful and as excited as we were to bring our friends to this restaurant, they were so upset about the service that they will not come back. It upsets me because I know yelp is an easy access for bad reviews and rarely do you get a good one, however, I hope Joe takes the coaching and witnesses the staff and makes changes. Our server not once refilled our drinks, when I had to tell her to refill the drinks she didn't even clear the empty ones. Food was forgotten and not brought out and we had to ask to remove it from our bill, and then when she brought the bill after not clearing our dishes, it was one check. We asked her to split it three ways and she throws the empty plates back on the table to walk back and change the bill. It took everything in me not to coach her on the spot and I just felt it wouldn't go far enough had I not given the owner the direct experience. I was embarrassed. I love this restaurant but if we keep receiving bad service, it won't be worth the trouble to come back.
