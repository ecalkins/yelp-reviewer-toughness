Since we had some time to wait, I had one of their home brewed Root Beers while playing a little video poker at the bar. The root beer is fantastic! Not too carbonated, and good flavor. Also no caffeine! I so wished I could have gotten some to make a root beer float with.

The BBQ menu is pretty basic. Baby back ribs and chicken, and combinations of those two. I went with a full rack of Baby backs. The plate was huge when they delivered it, with a side of corn on the cob, root beer baked beans, coleslaw, and some rolls. Plenty of food for $14.99. 

The ribs aren't smoked over an open fire, or at least didn't taste like it. They were tender, meaty, and good. The BBQ sauce is pretty basic with a sweetness to it. I wasn't disappointed with the ribs, but also wasn't overwhelmed thinking I finally found great BBQ in Vegas. The search will continue......."
