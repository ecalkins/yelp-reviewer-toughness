First, you have to walk through potentially the worst smelling (smoke) casino in all of Vegas to get to the cafe, which is non-smoking, so that's a plus.  The decor is nothing special, kind of reminds you of something you'd see in a movie set from the 70's.

The food is average, nothing special.  I had the prime rib dinner, it came with a baked potato, green beans a salad and a rootbeer (if you're over 21 the rootbeer can be substituted with one of their house crafted beers).  It was $12.99.  The price is great, but can easily be beat at 777 Brewery at Main Street Station and the food and ambience is better.  My friend had the chicken dinner and it was dry and over cooked.

Potentially the breakfast food is better, I don't know. But I'd say you can find much better, in the same price range elsewhere, ie 777 Brewery, which is also 24/7."
