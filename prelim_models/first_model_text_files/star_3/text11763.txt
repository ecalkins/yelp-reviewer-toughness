It's not easy to mess up brunch, but my table of 4 - none of us really enjoyed what we ordered. It wasn't horribly bad, but it wasn't satisfying. I stopped eating my Benedict after the first one and just left it there. I didn't even want to take it home. 

The pancakes were weird. When I cut into it, it was breaking apart. Almost as if the texture was hard and crunchy? Not pancake like at all. 

Also this place has the most expensive orange juice ever. My friend ordered a large orange juice (with no free refills) for $5.50. How outrageous is that?"
