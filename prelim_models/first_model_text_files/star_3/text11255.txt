The only reason I didn't rate this place higher was because of the cleanliness (or lack thereof).  On a not-so-busy Tuesday morning, we were sat next to an unbussed table that remained that way through our entire meal. The outdoor couches needed a good wipe and the fixtures were void of any light bulbs giving the space a very unfinished look. The restrooms were also in need of attention and they always say the cleanliness of a restaurant's restroom is an indication of the cleanliness of its kitchen. Just a listing sprucing up would make the experience much more pleasing."
