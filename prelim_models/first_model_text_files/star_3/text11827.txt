We got there and were seated outside and there were misters above us that were leaking. 
The service was a bit unprofessional and scattered, and I started to get worried. 

I ordered a skirt steak meal, and when it arrived I understood why everyone has been talking about this place. My steak was a bit cold, however it was absolutely delicious. 

SO- if you have the patience for it, it's definitely worth taking a chance on it."
