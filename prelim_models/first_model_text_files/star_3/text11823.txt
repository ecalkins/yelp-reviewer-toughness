Waited 10 mins for creamer for the coffee.. Coffee was already cold by then. Meals arrive, server quickly left before I could speak up and ask for hot sauce. Was then able to flagged her down, but it took another 15 mins to get my hot sauce. By the time the hot sauce came, food was already eaten because I was hungry. There was another table who sat down 5 minutes after I sat down and 3 different servers kept asking them if anyone helped them yet and they kept saying no, not yet. Sigh... The food was good however.............. #HmmNotSureBoutThisPlace
