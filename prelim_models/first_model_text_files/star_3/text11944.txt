Long waits I can handle - the place is practically a legend in the valley, but every time I go people in my party are left without things they ordered, drinks run out, things come out in the wrong order etc.  

On this last visit I ordered a few corn breads and told the server I wanted them to come out as an appetizer.  They came out with the main course and I just got a casual mention - ""sorry they took so long to come out"".  That kind of defeated the purpose of ordering them since now everyone was interested in their actual food.  We also noticed that the table seated near us - with about the same number in their party - were seated well after us and served before us.  And we didn't take very long to order it was just really slow and disorganized!  I was also a little sad because they didn't even bring syrup automatically, so of course I asked for it when they brought out our food.  Saw the server make a few more runs to other tables while my food got cold waiting for syrup...

Another member in the group realized his chicken and waffles from the KK never arrived... so we flagged down an employee who got our server.  They brought them out eventually but just so much that could have been better!  And not even an apology!  We only had a party of 7 so it's not like we took over the restaurant.  I think maybe the key here is to go, but not order any of the extras because it seems like that's where a lot of the problems come from."
