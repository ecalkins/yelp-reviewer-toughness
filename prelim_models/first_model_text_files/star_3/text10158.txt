The broth was not rich enough for me, and the noodles lacked a certain chewy-ness that is usually in Japanese ramen. 

Overall, I felt like it was a pretty good mediocre Japanese ramen place, it certainly wasn't the worst place I've been. If you find traditional ramen too rich for you, this may be the place for you. But if you are a ramen fanatic like me, it's certainly not ""the best ramen in Toronto"""
