But i came back a few weeks ago and to my surprise there was no line up at all and it was during lunch time. The ramen itself was still as good as I remembered, but the pork turned out to be very dry. Perhaps it was just a bad day for them, or perhaps they got lazy and that's why they no longer have the types of line ups they used to have."
