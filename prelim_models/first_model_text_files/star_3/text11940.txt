Dinner was good- really good.  Crispy chicken legs, gooey cheesy grits and creamy and yummy mac-n-cheese -the service was ok, but the peach cobbler was a complete disappointment.
Took over 15 mins and was room temperature -not hot or even lukewarm.
Not sure if the server forgot but it was a complete let down.

My fianc√© said it was the ice cream that cooled it.  But the fact that I could touch the ramekin told me otherwise.  Even half way down the cobbler, still not warm.  Won't order that ever again."
