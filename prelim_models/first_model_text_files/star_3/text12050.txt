It's kind of hit and miss one table gets in and out quickly while others wait. Not sure why.  We had the same food?  Servers could use some training.  After having mediocre service it is really bold of them to print a 20% tip at the bottom of the  check.  I normally do tip 20% or above for good service and a little less for poor service. That just left me feeling a little bitter.
