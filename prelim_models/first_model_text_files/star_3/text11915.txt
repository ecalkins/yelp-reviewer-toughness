Our waitress Danielle is what made the experience honestly. She gave great recommendations and helped us choose what to get and actually gave us her honest opinion of the food. 

I got the sausage gravy with eggs and potatoes, my boyfriend had the three piece chicken and waffle meal and we shared an Oreo pancake. Oh! And their sweet tea and kool-aid is where its at! 

My gravy came out cold as well as my potatoes. Since I'm in the service industry I hate complaining but its bs that my food was cold so I asked her to just heat the gravy back up and id deal with the rest. I was too hungry to wait for my food to be re cooked. So, she came back with the gravy (still not even hot) BUT about two minutes later Danielle brings me fresh steaming hot potatoes without me even asking for them. NOW THATS SERVICE. The chicken my boyfriend demolished and the waffles were frekking awesome. Not to mention that Oreo pancake alone I will come back for. 

Idk If the kitchen was in the weeds or if my plate had just been sitting in the window or what but sending out cold food is the worst thing in my opinion. 

Will be back to sit in Danielle's section, for sure. Kuddos to you! :)"
