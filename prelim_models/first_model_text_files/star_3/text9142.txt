I ordered the steak medium rare, it was pretty tough to chew, but for the price it was fine. Skip the shrimp cocktail - it was literally 2 pieces of shrimp chopped up with celery and cocktail sauce. Not worth it. Their beer however is. Can't go wrong with their beer offerings. I'll be back...eventually and maybe then I'll try their BBQ.
