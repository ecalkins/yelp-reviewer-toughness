I got the Tonkotsu Ramen, and the first sip of broth was really nice and creamy and I loved it while it was hot.  But by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl I found it really salty.  The pork tasted amazing, but there were only two thinly sliced pieces of it in the bowl.  The noodles were pretty good but at the same time, noodles can only get so good.  So while I did like the taste of the ramen, it's a little expensive for $9.25+tax+tip.  If there was more meat in the bowl and it was a bit cheaper, I'd give it one more star.

Also they don't take a waiting list there...you just have to stand in line in the order you came in, in the tiny space at the front of the restaurant."
