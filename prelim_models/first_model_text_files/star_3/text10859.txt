The tea selection is modest but I was beyond thrilled to find decaf English Breakfast.  For my meal I ordered the spanikopita crepe.  I was going to go for an omelet, but thought I should try something different that I can't get just anywhere.  The crepe was filled with spinach, onion, and feta cheese. It had an amazing flavor, but the crepe was rather rubbery. I actually felt like I was eating pizza rather than a crepe.  

My friend got an omelet that she really enjoyed and she also got the Nutella dessert crepe. Again, her crepe was very tough and rubbery and there was only a small smear of Nutella on it. 

I think if they tweak their recipe for crepe batter it could have far more potential to be an amazing food option. The omelet choices are pretty great. That's what I'll stick to, should I return."
