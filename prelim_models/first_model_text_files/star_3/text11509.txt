One thing they should consider is a change of music. When we went (Saturday 11/22/14) it was techno. Nothing wrong with techno, unless you're enjoying a beautiful meal on a Saturday morning, sitting on a lovely patio or comfortable chairs inside. Seemed out of place and harsh. Also, almost too 'expected' in it's Scottsdale location. 

The bathrooms are lovely, too."
