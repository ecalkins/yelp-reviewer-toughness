I was excited when seeing the variety of vegetarian friendly omelettes! It always sucks to go to a breakfast place where only one omelette is just veggies and the rest are meat. I went for the swiss chard, caramelized onion, and gruyere omelette with a side of pancakes and fruit (no pineapple because I'm slightly allergic). The omelette looked unappealing when they brought it out, but I didn't judge it based on looks. I don't know if the cheese was just too sweet for an omelette and I didn't like that or what, but it left me with a stomach ache lasting the whole day. The pancakes were kind of favorless, not as soft and fluffy as I prefer my pancakes. They also brought me fruit out with pineapple, which i requested no pineapple, when I told the server she was apologetic and happy to fix it. She handed it to her coworker to fix and he said ""Can't I just take it off?"" and she said no, which I am glad about. They brought me a nice bowl of fresh fruit, but it was more than my friend had on his skewer!
It was a little pricey as well. Expected though, as it is a nicer breakfast place in Scottsdale! Overall, not very tempted to come back, mostly because of the stomach ache. There might be something much better on the menu though that I did not get so I have not completely written this place off yet."
