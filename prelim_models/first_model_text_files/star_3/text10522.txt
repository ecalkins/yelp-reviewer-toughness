Very flavourful and it just hits the spot. Comes with lots of meat and a medium cooked egg that's always cooked to perfection. You have the choice of small or large noodles (I usually go with the larger noodles). One thing I was a bit disappointed about was that there was no spicy option for all the ramen flavours, however they do give you some chilli powder on the side so you can add in as much as you want... But it's just not the same :P. Service is friendly and fast. It's a ramen place that I wouldn't mind coming back to but I don't think I love it enough to line up for it.
