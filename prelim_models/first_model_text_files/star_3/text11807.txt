The hostess greeted us immediately with a smile and sat us at a table near the kitchen. Great start. Our service was ok. There were maybe 5 other tables taken at 11:45am on a Tuesday but got as much attention as if the place were packed. The servers all looked bored and less than thrilled to be there. I'm giving 3 stars is for the food. The Salmon omelette was HUGE and pretty comparable to similar dishes I've had elsewhere. Fruit was fresh and hash browns were perfectly cooked (in my opinion). Might give it another go on a weekend morning to get the full experience :)
