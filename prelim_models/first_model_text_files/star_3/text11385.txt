By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting an out of this world egg breakfast experience. We ordered coffee, fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice, the fried truffle egg toast, stuffed brioche french toast, prosciutto flat bread, a side of bacon and hash browns. The main dishes ranged from $12-14 each.

Service was great and our food came within 15 minutes after our order. The portions are huge and initially the food looked inviting.

Fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice-Delightful, crisp and refreshing. Highly recommended!

Coffee-Not particularly smooth, a little bland, average.

Fried truffle egg toast-It came out as two pieces of French toast. The first piece had the fried egg, asparagus, fontina cheese, and truffle butter. The serving was large and was sufficient to leave one feeling very stuffed.

Prosciutto flat bread-This was our least favorite dish. It seemed like the prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, asparagus, parmesan, fried egg, and balsamic reduction was carelessly tossed onto the bread. It was extremely salty. 

Stuffed Brioche French Toast-This was our favorite dish and works well as a breakfast dessert. I loved the stuffed mascarpone, bananas, and nutella.

By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting spEGGtacular or EGGcellent, but instead it was just rEGGular. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or wait, but if I were in the area early in the morning, I might try it again."
