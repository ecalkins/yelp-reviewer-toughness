My wife's savory crepes had a good savory filling, but the crepe itself was sweet. This made for a combination that neither of us cared for. 

The menu was full of interesting sounding items. I suspect the best things here are the omelettes and Benedicts.  I'll try that next. 

The bacon was the best bacon I've had in my whole life!"
