Service was SUPER quick - seriously no waiting but this is the slow Vegas season, so maybe that's why.

Ribs were meaty, perfectly cooked, and fit well with the BBQ sauce.  Sides of beans (boring) coleslaw (sub-par at best) and corn on the cob (decent, but probably frozen first) left LOTS to be desired.

Total with the coupon and a few beers was about $20.00.  Good value"
