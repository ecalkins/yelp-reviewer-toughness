My personal recommendations are the most expensive ramens: the Tonkotsu Black and the Miso Black. Mmmmm. You will not regret ordering. The second is even more photogenic and garnished with a flower. Chashu pork is sliced thinner than other ramen restaurants but packed with taste.

The thing about this location compared to other locations I've been to is that the space is super cramped and the service slumps. Unless you're fortunate enough to score 1 of 2 booths in the back, you'll be sat at the same table as other guests with your belongings touching if you have frumpy bags or coats. Their lunch and dinner service is BUSY - meaning you'll be asked to stand outside the store in a line without a number (do not dare to leave the line) for between 5-25 minutes, which is long enough for me to say screw it and find someplace else to eat. The servers are professional but you can tell they're constantly on fast-paced mode - they welcome guests and thank them as they leave but from what I've experienced, monotony, passively, and without eye contact. They also rush to give you your bill. No need to ask, they'll hit you with ""together or separate?"" as soon as you finish and they clear your plate. The food is great, unfortunately not the right place to dine comfortably during meal times."
