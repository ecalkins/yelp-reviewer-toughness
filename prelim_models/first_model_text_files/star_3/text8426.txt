5 stars for the cheap drinks, 2 stars for the the size and crowd. So averages about a 3, in my opinion. 

Drinks here are HELLA cheap. If you are a local or a tourist and like to have fun and drink without breaking the bank or your pocket, then it's a place to go.

As far as karaoke goes, if you are looking for a place to sing, good luck, because the wait time is about an hour and a half to 2 hours. And if you LOVE to sing, better be there early and plan on staying ALL NIGHT, and also bring some sanitizing wipes, because the ""mixed"" crowd, well for lack of a better word, it's not the most appealing, clean looking or hygienically speaking. Or better yet, just sit your butt down and just sing along at your table and dont even worry about getting up and singing , because the place is small, and it feels like youre in a crew ship, the ceilings are low, and feels like i can reach it without jumping (and I'm about 5'3"") so I hope that gives you the idea..

Anywho.. i go back there from time to time, for pre party purposes only."
