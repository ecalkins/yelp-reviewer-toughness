Sandwich wasn't bad, but for the price I paid ($7.75 before tax) I was expecting a lot more food or something spectacular, like Capriotti's. The bread was good and so was the fruit, but I don't think I'd order it again...I could make it myself for way cheaper.
Maybe their breakfast food is better..."
