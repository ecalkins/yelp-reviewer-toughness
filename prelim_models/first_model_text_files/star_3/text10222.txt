While the karaage was tasty, and done just right in terms of texture and moisture, what I didn't enjoy (and I guess this is just personal preference) was that they didn't offer leaner cuts of pork - I got very fatty cuts, which were kind of gross...

I'd say this place stacks up below the pack in terms of the other ramen powerhouses like Santouka, Raijin and Kinton.

If you're a ramen adventurer like myself - give it a shot anyway as it'll still hit the spot of getting your ramen fix on :9"
