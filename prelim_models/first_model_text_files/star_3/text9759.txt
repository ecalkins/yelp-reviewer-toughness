Let me first say, that I have never eaten in the restaurant. All of my experiences with Beach cafe have been via carryout or delivery.  As I mentioned, the food is good, the problem is getting the food you actually ordered.  Of the 5 times I have ordered from them, 3 of them we wrong. Not just a little wrong like ""oh bummer they forgot the ranch"" wrong, but like ""WTH?! This isn't what I ordered at all"" wrong. 

When you can manage to get the food you ask for, this place is great unfortunately, that only seems to happen about 40% of the time."
