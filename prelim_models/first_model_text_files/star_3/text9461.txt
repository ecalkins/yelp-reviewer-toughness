It took several weeks BUT I FINALLY got a resolution my matter with Ellis Island. The hotel's operations supervisor....Ricardo FINALLY called me back regarding getting the issue of getting my money refunded. Due to a family emergency that occured while in route to Las Vegas with my husband we never got to check in or even stay in the hotel but I was charged even though I informed staff of the emergency. He apologized for any misunderstanding that had occurred due to my issues with other staff members at the hotel. Assured me the issue would be addresses appropriately. Since I have yet to actually stay at the hotel I can't speak for what the hotel experience of staying at Ellis Island is like, but I can say that after speaking with Ricardo I will be willing to reconsider at staying at Ellis Island. I only wish that my experience didn't have to be so stressful but I'm glad to finally have the issue resolved. I look forward to giving a more updated review in the near future regarding my hotel stay experience. Thanks."
