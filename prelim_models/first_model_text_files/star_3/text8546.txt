Once you validate the card you will receive coupons for food and drink specials. Go for the BB Rib dinner half or full rack. The dinners include BBQ Beans Corn on the Cob, Cole Slaw and Garlic Bread.  Not necessarily the best BBQ but definitely a value meal. The Beans are not very flavorful but the Cole Slaw is very good. Worth a visit if you are near the strip.
The dining room décor is not the strip ambiance. The décor, along with the tables and chairs are a little dated and the walk thru the casino a little smoky. This is an old time Las Vegas locals place."
