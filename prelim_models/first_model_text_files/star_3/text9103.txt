They cooked the steak perfectly (medium rare) but it was very hard to chew, flavorful but tough meat. The french fries came kindda cold and the service was not very helpful.
Seems to me she was very busy, because we had to ask for straws and water refills several times until we got the 1 refill.
The beer was fantastic, both the stout and the other one ;-)"
