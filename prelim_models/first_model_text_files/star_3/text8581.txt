I went during an NFL football game and the deal is $1 for any 20oz of Ellis Island's brew; there are no flights offered but for $1 you can try all 5-6 of their brews no problem.  They also offer food deals for $1-2 as well.

The beer itself is nothing to venture out for.  The stout is probably the best option, while the others seemed watered down/unflavorful.  The IPA had no hop taste whatsoever.

If you want cheap booze, hang with locals, and drink near the strip, Ellis Island is great.  If you are looking for quality, craft beer, then I would go elsewhere and spend the extra $5.  Parking is also tough at this casino sometimes so beware.  But overall the price of the beer is enough for me to come back again."
