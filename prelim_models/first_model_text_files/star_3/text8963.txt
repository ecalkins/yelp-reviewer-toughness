What Ellis Island doesn't offer in ambiance, it returns in quality and value of food and service.  Drive by fast and you'd never know it's there!  Except for the returning fans who stand in line all day, sometimes for as long as an hour, to get a table.  Like many Las Vegas restaurants, Ellis Island has ""off the menu"" specials, one of which here is the $9.99 steak dinner.  it includes a well-chosen, succulent steak cooked to order (NOT like the gristly, tough shoe leather they pass off as steak down the street at Mr. Lucky's (at the Hard Rock).  Add to that a choice of soup or salad, choice of potato, freshly prepared vegetables (I usually receive green beans sauteed in garlic & butter) AND your choice of a tall ice cold beer or root beer, BOTH brewed right there on site!  When you walk away from Ellis Island, your wallet will thank you, your stomach will thank you, your friends and family will thank you, and most of all, you'll say to yourself ""WOW! that was actually a really good dining experience! I never expected that kind of quality and value from such a meager place!""  TWO THUMBS UP FOR ELLIS ISLAND!"
