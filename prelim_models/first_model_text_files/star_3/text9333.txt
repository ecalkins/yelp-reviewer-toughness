The service is okay, the food portion was pretty big though. None of us can finish the food, and the huge cup of beer! The quality of steak was cheap, if you are trying to get medium, you should order medium rare, since they tend to overcook it a little. 

Place is a little smoky, but overall experience was not bad. Will come back if we want some cheap steaks!"
