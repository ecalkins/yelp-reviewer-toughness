The lineup is outside and based on first-come-first-serve and you queue with everyone else. I was outside for about 40 minutes before I was seated. 

First thing I noticed when I was seated was how inefficient the seating is. There are two booths that probably fits 2 people, then a few tables for 6, and a table at the very front facing outside. They didn't sit anyone at the table facing outside (which was dumb), and they would have two groups of 2 sitting at a table for 6. While it'll be faster to stick 3 groups of 2 there, it's also awkward because one side of the seat is attached to the wall so it'll be hard to go out. Whoever designed this place doesn't know anything about restaurants.

Second, I only ordered the Tonkotsu (pork bone broth). It came with a soft boiled egg, two small pieces of pork belly, and Chinese fungus. At first, it tasted pretty good but when you get to the bottom of the bowl, it gets progressively saltier. Also the noodles were a bit too starchy for my taste. Something about them were a bit off.

Overall, it was good and I'd return again."
