The food is ok most of the time, but a couple of times I had horrible eggs. As in not edible. 

I've never had a five star experience here, with either food nor service. Mostly disappointing. But worth three 

But alas, in the name of saving time, in a rush to get breakfast on the way out of town, I recently went back. 

BUT....This last time I visited they seemed to have better knowledgeable staff that knew what they were doing!! Amazingly different than before! 

My order was correct! as in I got the meal I ordered(most of time there are mistakes) 

My eggs came out over medium just like I ordered! (NEVER  happened before in approx 5previous visits) 

The waitress checked on us throughout the meal!  Again, this is new. 

I was delighted at the transformation they seem to be doing.  The place seemed cleaner. The staff is different & more professional.

Good job on the improvements.  Thanks eggstasy I will try again, and hopefully have better experiences. I'm actually rooting for you!  The 'better quality breakfast business competition is actually very nearby, one across the street and one about two miles away, but with this  being walking distance from me, is why I hope for eggstasy, to get it together. 

If they would just play appropriate, less jarring music, it would be a more comfortable place to eat. And I'd be less inclined to drive for my morning meals."
