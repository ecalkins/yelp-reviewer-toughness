It came with smoked gouda and it was just two thick slices I side of the omelette... the cheese wasn't even warm... like, they cooked the omelette, then added the cheese. I was holding my coffee and when I went to let it go, it stuck to my hand because of how dirty the cup was. They also make you pay for tiny water bottles... I like to drink a lot of water, and had I known that is have to pay for it, i would have brought my own. The waiter offered me a new coffee but I declined because I just wanted to leave. He went to grab the check and came back with dessert, which was thoughtful and delicious... but that was the only part of my breakfast that I even enjoyed. I doubt I'll come back here. I had much higher hopes based on the many photos and rave reviews.
