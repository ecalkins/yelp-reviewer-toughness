For some reason now the wait is forever to get your food. Both times I've been it was close to an hour after we ordered. I realize too that they are a bit overpriced and now because of the parking and long wait times I told my husband we will find another local southern restaurant. And can the waiters please start wiping off the drinks before they serve them? Our drinks had so much condensation our entire table was wet and there were no napkins until we asked. They need to have those out on the table already. Oh and unless you get a booth be ready for your butt and back to hurt as you sit there in these weird chairs for 2.5 hours.
