They open at 11am but when I walked over around 11:45am there was already a line of about 10 people lining up and standing outside waiting to go in. The crazy part was that the temperature outside was just slightly below freezing level (30 degrees Fahrenheit or rather -1 degrees Celsius) and yet here we all are... After about 15-20 minutes, my sister and I were finally seated. We ordered the tonkotsu black and and the spicy tantan.

- Tonkotsu Black: Creamy pork broth with roasted black garlic oil. It had a decent depth to it however I felt it could've been a touch stronger and richer. I wasn't particularly impressed, but it really wasn't too bad either. The chasu was not succulent and did not melt in my mouth. 
- Spicy Tantan: This ramen had a nice heat to it. But unfortunately it lacked any other flavor aside from just being spicy. My sister did prefer this ramen over the tonkotsu black as she felt the other one is too heavy and fatty, but I wouldn't trust her judgment since she's never really eat ramen aside from packaged ramen. Haha.

Overall, I did not think this place is all that and am not sure why people would line up in the cold for this. I mean unless this is the best Toronto can offer which is sad in itself. The prices are super reasonable which is the only reason why I did not drop my rating to two stars."
