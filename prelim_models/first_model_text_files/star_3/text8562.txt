The $7.99 steak special is not on the menu, but it's advertised everywhere in the casino and on the TV in the cafe so you can't miss it. It's a 10 oz sirloin filet that comes with soup/salad and a choice of potatoes including baked. My friend ordered the $12.99 prime rib dinner which includes soup/salad, choice of potatoes including baked and either a root beer or an Ellis Island beer (no substitution). The sirloin was ok once I drenched it with A1 steak sauce, but if you're here drunk or after a late night partying, you probably won't care. If you're looking for a dinner meal like I was, go for the prime rib dinner. It has good flavors and is juicy, but best part of the dinner is the beer which is brewed right in Ellis Island and has won numerous awards. The prime rib dinner will make sure you're full as you can be."
