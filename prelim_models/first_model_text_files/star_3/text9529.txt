Just $2 more, but worth the price! If you go to Tuscany, their late night specials still include the steak and eggs for $3.99. 

My friend and I were on our way out of Vegas and decided to drop by. For a Sunday lunch, the wait time was 30 minutes. That's not a problem because we decided to hit up the slots! They will also give you a pager to notify you when your table is available.  If you open a new reward card with them, you'll get a chance to spin the wheel to see how much you'll get on free slot play. The range is $10 - $500, but I think everyone just gets $10. The machines are good for this small casino. They have some of the newer machines that you'd find on the strip. 

When we finally sat down, we placed our orders. I enjoyed my steak and eggs. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for $5.99. I also ordered some orange juice and coffee (the orange juice was awesome! freshly squeezed). Oddly, the price of the drinks was just the same as the steak and eggs, so my total was approximately $12 for the meal...not too shabby! 

Overall, I am giving this place 3 stars because it includes both the casino and restaurant. The place is off the strip, so it's attracting a different kind of crowd. Also, the casino was really dark. The restaurant offers good deals and that's probably the only reason why I'll come here again."
