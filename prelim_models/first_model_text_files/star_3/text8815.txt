Luckily my daughter said she had a headache,  and wanted to wait in car, so we ate. The food was okay, for the price, the sides? They were not tasty at all. Service was quick, and it looks like it's always packed. It's small too. Now, the place I'm talking about, is the BBQ joint in the back room. Didn't get the name,  I just know it's in that casino. One other thing, they don't do to go orders. You can order the food, which they'll bring to your table, then you ask for a to go box, yeah, another strange thing. Hope you enjoy.
