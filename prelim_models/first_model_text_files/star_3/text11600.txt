My friend and I sat outside, and it was very pretty and then it got super hot we asked our waiter to move and he forgot about us. We then gave our order, my friend got the skinny burrito and I got the steak and eggs. I was excited when the food came, only to find a hair in my eggs. I told the waiter, and he did not apologize, he just said, ""that is a hair"" and took my plate with the eggs. He came back and said that he would have a new egg out shortly... it never came. I had to ask for water 3x because he kept forgetting, along with ketchup. My friend said her burrito was amazing, meanwhile my food was okay. I think the service put a bad taste in my mouth. The bill came, and I still tipped the guy because that is who I am. I told the manager and she was very friendly, and apologized to me for the poor service.  She even gave me a 20.00 gift certificate to make up for it. She was very professional and I appreciated that. However, I am a first impression kind of gal, so I gave the gift certificate to my friend. I probably won't go back. Also there was no chocolate bacon, which was my reason for going in the first place after reading the yelp reviews. I was very disappointed."
