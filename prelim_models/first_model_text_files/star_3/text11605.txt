The only negative thing I have to say is that they would not seat us because our whole ""party"" was not there yet... 2/3 of us were there, but they ended up seating a incomplete party of 4/9 people who arrived after us and the whole party wasn't even there yet! Other than that odd rule- the food was great, good atmosphere & the waiter was nice and attentive."
