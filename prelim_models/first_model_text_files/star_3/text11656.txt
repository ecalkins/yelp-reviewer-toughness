Service was hectic and awful but our server was nice enough. He was on his 3rd day and was not familiar with the menu. We ordered two breakfast items and two lunch items. 

Wife ordered a signature Bloody Mary and it looked terrific with the chocolate covered bacon and all. But was way over spiced with horseradish. 

The orange juice was not cold but did taste like fresh. The water was sadly filled with cucumber. Upon request, they brought regular water too.

In the final analysis, we can't give it more than 3 stars."
