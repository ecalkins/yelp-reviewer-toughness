Personally, not fond of the creamy broths that are typical to Hokkaido styled ramen, so I don't enjoy my ramen bowls from here.  BUT, I love their tsukemen!  The concept behind tsukemen is for the broth to lightly coat the noodle, as opposed to the noodle submerging in, and absorbing the flavour of the broth.

If you want to try something new, why not give it a shot?"
