The french toast was also delicous but the canadian bacon was rubbery and tasteless and the hash browns were funky tasting.  The waiter was attentive BUT $42 tip  +  FOR BREAKFAST WITH NO ALCOHOL IS STIFF AND I CAN AFFORD IT. Will i go back yes but no cappuccino at $4 x2 and no canadian bacon at $4 no potatoes at $4 x 2 savings $20 +tax and tip.  There are other options around town like the Breakfast Club which is always consistant.  +-$32.  I give Egstasy a 78%.
