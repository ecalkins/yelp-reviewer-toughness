""Jeremy, you're up. Jeremy, come to the stage. Jeremy? Going, going, gone!""

""Sarah, come to stage. It's your time to sing, Sarah. Sarah? Okay, who's next?""

""Fallon! Let's get Fallon up here ladies and gentlemen! No Fallon? Moving on.""

""Arthur, you ready bud?! Where's Arthur at? Arthur's not here?""

Okay, you get my point, this place is a disorganized mess when it comes to karaoke. For every five or six names called to sing on a Friday night, maaaaaybe one or two of them were actually there to sing. The same name would often get called within a few songs of each other and you have no idea any kind of time frame that you may actually get your turn to jump on stage. 

This could easily be remedied with a chalkboard or even a maintained signup sheet on a clipboard where past singer's name are checked off as they sing. Is the concept revolutionary? Heck no, but it works even at the crummiest karaoke bars that I've been to. Two hours and six cocktails later and I still didn't get a shot at stardom at Ellis Island. Three stars earned for an overall great crowd..."
