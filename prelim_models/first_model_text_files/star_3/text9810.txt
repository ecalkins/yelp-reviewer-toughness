The place is certainly a dive and for sure doesn't serve ""awesome"" burgers as the door indicated.  

The burger meat is either frozen burgers or old
Ground beef. 

The ingredients weren't all that fresh. The bun is probably the only decent thing about my Ortega burger. It was suppose to be hot with chiles and pepper jack cheese. Nothing about it was spicy hot!!  

I do like my burgers well done, so I can give it to the cook for accomplishing that!!  

One thing that bothered us was that we came in and placed our order and four people came in after us, sitting next to us.  They actually got their order before we got ours which I found odd. 

There was a blond lady that worked their and her hair looked super dirty and it was flowing down. 


It is decorated in a cute way, we moved here from Florida and in Florida we find lots of burger joints just like this but with better food!"
