I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...

Review #13:
the hotel for this joint is the next door Super 8, so that should tell you a lot right there; it is old-school, semi-smoky, and very small; you can walk around the perimeter in 5 minutes (if you're walking slow!); very little to recommend this place except 2 things: eating & drinking!; the Cafe specials are legendary, and they also have a Metro Pizza outlet which is basically just a counter and some tables, but it's hard to beat their quality vs. price ratio on pizzas & strombolis; best of all, they make their own beer here, and it's $2 per pint - yep, that is not a typo - you give the bartender a $10 bill, and he gives you a full pint of amber, stout, pale ale, or whatever, plus $8 of change - it's crazy!; best craft beer bet = well, ""craft"" beer might be a slight stretch, but they only serve their own homemade juice, and it sure beats macro-beer Bud/Coors/Miller swill; did I mention it's only $2 per pint?"
