I would say it's a medium sized bowl compared to bowls at other ramen restaurants, so I didn't feel I was getting enough bang for my buck.  I was slightly surprised by how light the broth was.  Opaque, sure.  Creamy, enough so.  There was just this brightness to it that I am not sure how to explain.  I would recommend ordering the thick noodle (as opposed to original or thin) to make for a heartier meal.  

And oh, just for adorable kicks, when I received my bowl of ramen, the seaweed and the two boiled eggs made for a happy face.  On a very cold, windy night, it was a warm and friendly treat!

SERVICE AND AMBIENCE: Very sweet, prompt, and attentive staff.  They were gracious and patient, when I volunteered to move to the window bar seating when a large party came in, and I was sitting at the only table that could seat them all.  Also, I thankfully arrived before a line started, but they do have a policy of making you wait outside until a table is ready.  There is a windy draft by the door, so on cold days, keep your coat on!!"
