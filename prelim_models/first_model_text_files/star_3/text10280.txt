The waitresses kept trying to push us out of the restaurant! I understand that there's a line for people to be seated, but refusing to re-fill our glasses of water and shoving us the bill isn't appreciated. The line wasn't even that long! There were literally 5 people (2 different tables) waiting to be seated.

Not only that, but they gave us the wrong change after we paid for our meal. That, in my opinion, is absolutely unacceptable. Asian jokes regarding math skills aside, no restaurant should ever make that mistake.

Great food, cool decor, decent prices, bad service. Still, the ramen was pretty damn good. Try the Tonkotsu!"
