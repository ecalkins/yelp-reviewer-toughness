Pros:  Really unique menu options and the food is really good. The staff is also very friendly.

Cons:
It's really, REALLY loud in there!  I feel like I'm in a middle school cafeteria.  It doesn't help that they play club music which just makes people talk louder.
The service can be really slow. I've either had to wait to have my order taken or wait to cash out.  
They tend to mess up the order. The first time I was there I got the wrong pancakes. The second time I was there my omelet was wrong. I was there today and although I ordered the banana crepes, I got the french toast.  I can only assume they screw up the order because they can't hear me correctly since it's so LOUD!!
They also tend to do a hit and run when dropping off the food. Not once in the three times I was there did the runner ask if I needed anything. As a result, I had to flag down or wait for the server to get ketchup, extra napkins or anything else for that matter.

Overall, if you want good eclectic food options give it a try; just be prepared to shout and get a slightly different version of what you ordered."
