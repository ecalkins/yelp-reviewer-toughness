My only qualm is that the entire breakfast menu is no longer 24 hours, which makes for a sad me when I went with hopes of a crispy chicken fried steak and eggs at 3 in the afternoon.  Mind you I haven't been here in a year or so, and have no idea when this changed, there are still 3 breakfast specials you can choose all day.
