Sure, I have my noodle attacks as frequently as the next guy but most of my ramen experience range from home made instant variety to a few challenging bowls at Zyng and Kenzo.  

My hubby and I went to Sansotei while we were looking for Santouka.  I was misinformed that Santouka was already open (which it's not!) and walked into this little ramen shop.  Since enough people have commented on the decor and other stuff I'll get right to the food. 

We ordered Miso ramen, Donkotsu Shoyu ramen and a green tea mochi ice cream (only kind they had available at the time).  Miso ramen came with a boiled egg (nice and medium), 2 pieces of ChaShu (port belly), corn, bean sprouts and topped with a generous mound of chopped green onion.  The broth was milky looking and tasted mildly porky and hearty.  I didn't really taste too much miso but it was well balanced nonetheless.  The noodles were cooked to perfect chewiness, not too chewy and not too mushy.  So far so good.  

Donkotsu Shoyu came topped with the same boiled egg, ChaShu, bamboo shoots and chopped green onion.  The broth was clearer than my Miso ramen and tasted a lot porkier which was a definite minus for me.  

Green tea mochi was just a ok.  I would have liked to try a different one as I'm not a huge fan of green tea ice creams.  It's just been overdone in the City, in my opinion.  I would have preferred either red bean or taro.  

All in all, the service was efficient, food was decent but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here again.  I'm definitely waiting for Santouka for my next downtown ramen jaunt."
