We ordered a three cheese omelet, veggie omelet and a spinach and blue cheese omelet with goat cheese substituted for the bleu cheese. We also ordered a side order of Apple Gouda chicken sausage. Unfortunately, as has been noted in previous reviews, the restaurant is extremely noisy. While some might find this pleasant, I go out for breakfast for a social environment and not being able to hear my table mates is a downer. In addition, it clearly impaired the servers understanding of our order because she came back twice to clarify the goat cheese substitution on the bleu cheese omelet and also thought we had ordered Apple Gouda chicken sausage crepes, both of which were clarified. Despite this, somehow I got a veggie omelet with goat cheese. Definitely not what I wanted. It could have been avoided if the server had repeated the order when she took it. 

The omelets are huge and when served with two pancakes are more than enough and none of us finished our omelets. I would suggest two people splitting an omelette as an alternative to waste. 

Overall, I would have to be in a specific mood to eat, not converse and would have to make sure the order was correct to go back. A shame because I think it has potential but not with the decibel factor is generates."
