The waitresses in the cafe are extremely rude if your not a regular if you have a large party they tend to get upset that you had the nerve to come with a lot of people the black jack dealers are also very rude and since the remodel parking is not as easy but if you can avoid paying attention to all that then it's ok for food and blowing time"
