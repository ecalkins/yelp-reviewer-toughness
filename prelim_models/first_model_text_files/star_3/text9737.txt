The decor reminded me of a beach front cafe in Kauai and I  sure didn't feel I was in the middle of the desert. My order the South Beach Burger - sauteed peppers and onions, pepper Jack cheese and a southwest sauce. The burger was decent and was decent sized. I've had better and worse. Fries were average also. 

Our waitress, who was Asian and cute took good care of us with the exception that I had to go to the counter to pay.

The place offers a frequency card which is a plus for all you locals."
