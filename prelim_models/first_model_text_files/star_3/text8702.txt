Of course, I got seafood, and didn't get red meat (I know, I don't know why, especially when this place is known for its red meat). I enjoyed our time there, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, it was a late Friday afternoon (5pm). Enjoyed shrimp alfredo and got out of there. Didn't realize there was a free beer with certain orders, I would have gotten that, had I known. Was tired, and after a long workday this place worked.
