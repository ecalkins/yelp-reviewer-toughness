It's open 24 hours, and that's what brought us to Ellis in the first place.

We've been here few times, and have tried meat lovers skillet, country fried steak, BLT sandwich, steak and egg, and prime rib. They were all mediocre. 

I don't think I'll be going back to this place, but if you are on a budget, you might want to give it a try."
