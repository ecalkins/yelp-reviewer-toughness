I guess timing was a little off since it was around 2 pm because there weren't a whole lot of choices and what I ended up with didn't taste incredibly fresh. I would definitely try this place again at a more normal feeding time to prove myself wrong.  In terms of sandwiches, they had some variety, but those were a little pricey.
