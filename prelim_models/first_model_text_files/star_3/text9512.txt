When im craving prime rib and dont want to pay 60 bucks to get it at the buffet this is my next spot and at $15 with a beer you cant beat that unless your in the industry than its 2 free beers and $10 for the prime rib. This place is good not great but good, i cant get over the fact of all the packets of sauce they give you when you order a baked potato and that whipped horse radish gets in my head, nothing fresh? Overall you cant beat the prices of this spot and you get what you pay for so you cant complain. But the prime rib i will be back"
