Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't great either. For all the hype I heard it was a huge let down.

The interior of the restaurant is designed very well and the overall setting is comfortable. The staff was friendly and the service was fine. 

Let me start by saying breakfast is one of my favorite meals. I ordered the breakfast panini with fruit on the side. The food was ready within a average amount of time. The sandwich itself was the most depressing part. My eyes gleamed with excitement as they placed it in front of me. I took a bite and confusion immediately set in. The meal looked so wonderful but the taste told me otherwise. Was this a wolf in sheep's clothing deceiving me? The only way I can describe it was that it just tasted bland, it was missing every flavor it listed on the menu. Specifically the eggs, they just didn't taste like eggs should and I'm sorry my poor vocabulary knowledge can't give your imagination a clear picture of how it was. It included avocado, peppers, onions, and bacon I believe. I'm not sure why, maybe because they cooked it with the other ingredients and it affected the taste? I found myself dousing it in Cholula sauce to help give it some flavor. The bread was perfectly crisp and was the only satisfying crunch. The side fruit came out on a skewer and I only had like 6 half pieces of fruit which was disappointing. The sandwich just wasn't that great, I only ate half and I'm a non-picky starving 23 year old. My friends pancakes looked tasty but I didn't try them. I'm sure something else on the menu would be better. It was my first time there, but I would only return if someone else suggested it."
