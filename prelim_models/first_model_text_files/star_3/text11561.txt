Sweet and salty mixed goodness is a true and tried recipe that seldom fails. Even without the Bloody Mary, I would just order the chocolate covered bacon on its own.

I've been here a few times, and the first time, our group was give pumpkin pancake with cream cheese type icing for free to sample. It was very dessert like and pleasant!

The corned beef hash is pretty good to order when hungry. I thought the crispy pancetta Benedict was a bit more memorable. Then again, I'm partial to the richness of Hollandaise sauce. 

If you come here on a Friday morning close to when they open, then service is amazing. The waitress even told me to take a breath of fresh air instead of looking at my phone and focusing on taking foodie pics and actually enjoy the food. She was so hilarious and on top of everything.

Coming here on Sunday's especially around ""11am-noonish,"" good luck. There's usually a list to wait for a table and service will be hit or miss because there's just too many d@#n people to wait on. I'm not blaming the staff, it's actually really good that they're that busy but I can tell there's a little more stress around. Food remains un-compromised and just as tasty."
