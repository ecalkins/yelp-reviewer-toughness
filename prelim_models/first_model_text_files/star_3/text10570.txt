I must admit the noodles and the broth seemed of great quality, but it wasn't tasty nor delicious enough to justify a recommendation or a second visit back to this place. 

There was a 5 minute wait when we arrived on a Saturday at noon for lunch. We were surprised there was no wait, but of course a line started forming shortly after we were seated. We had the bar seats near the window, which we didn't mind. Despite having people watching me eat from outside, it was not a bother. The service was quick and the menu was easy to read. The restaurant is pretty tiny and slim so it was hard to walk without bumping into people's chairs. 

We had to get the black ramen, the bf got the black tonkotsu ramen and I had the black miso ramen, both opted for thin noodles. We got our foods in less than 10 minutes. The broth was honestly something I could not remember. The taste was a bit odd and I was sad I couldn't make it spicy. They provided the basic spice powder which is more for flavoring than taste. The thin noodles were too thin, I think we should've gotten thick noodles instead. The bf's black tonkotsu ramen tasted weird, he thought mines tasted better. The portion was decent and there were enough pork slices. I was quite full towards the end. The broth wasn't delicious enough for us to finish. On the bright side, my ramen dish came with a flower and the presentation looked great. Total came out to a little less than $30 CAN. I must admit, the mushrooms in my ramen were great. Best part of the meal. 

Overall, this was just okay. We decided not to try any other ramen spots in Toronto after this experience; perhaps we are just blessed with great Asian foods in CA. Hehe."
