I ordered the Spicy TanTan ramen with thick noodles. Inside there was pork belly, ground pork, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, an egg and green onions. The meal came fairly quickly, as the servers needed to turn the tables as quickly as possible. When I tried the broth, it was flavourful; mild and not too spicy, but I did feel that it was a bit too salty. However, the noodles and the toppings were well-cooked and yummy.

Also, I felt that the portion size was a bit small. The ramen bowl cost $9.60, but I was still hungry after the meal was over. 

Overall, the ramen is decent, but there are many other ramen places that are probably just as good that offer a better price for a larger quantity of food."
