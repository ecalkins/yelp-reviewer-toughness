I tried this the last time I was there & my steak was slightly on the salty side but the eggs & potatoes were nicely cooked.

As far as location, it's away from the strip so it's better to take an uber or cab over since the area is not very well lit at night time so I wouldn't recommend walking. 

If you're looking for a place with affordable steak & prime rib then this is the place to go. It's also nice that they are open 24/7 so its convenient for late night dining."
