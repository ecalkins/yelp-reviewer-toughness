The place is quite small and quite compact, which I don't mind normally but sharing tables I didn't like that one bit. What if I want to act weird and go ham while eating, other people going to be weirded out as they see me so didn't like the sharing table part.

The ramen is quite good but the portion is quite small.. like smaller then usual from what I've eaten at other ramen places. The price seems the same but dang I was still hungry after and usually that's not a good sign of eating a meal. 

The ramen had one egg which was quite nice and two pieces of pork belly... like two thin pieces.. like c'mon give me a couple more I'm paying $10 for so little food. Service was nice from the short experience we had. Just disappointed with the food portion for being number 1. Although I am Asian and if I pay $10 for a bowl of ramen I'd hope to get a decent size portion with lots of toppings or meat (for me at least). Especially from an Asian place too! You think they'd got you but nah! I just feel cheaped out by this place."
