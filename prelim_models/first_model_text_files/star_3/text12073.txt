Lo-Los has some great, fun food. I'd recommend any location but this one. The parking is very limited whether it's a busy day or not. 
I've visited the Scottsdale location twice and received dreadful service each time. Including, 20 minute wait for water (yes, you read that correctly), mixed up orders, inattentive service, and rude staff."
