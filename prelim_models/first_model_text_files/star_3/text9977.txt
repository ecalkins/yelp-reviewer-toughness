Beware - the waiting area is outside of the restaurant and they don't give out numbers so you cannot leave your place in line. Remember to bring a jacket for the cool winter days!

After being seated, I ordered the Shio Ramen with regular noodles. When the bowl arrived, I was surprised at how much green onion they gave me. It actually looked like I ordered green onion soup with ramen on the side... 

The ramen itself was not the typical ramen you'd get. It was more like noodles you could get at a supermarket rather than some kind of specialty ramen you'd expect after an hour's wait. 

The chashu was interesting. Although it was mostly fat, I think they used a fire gun or a similar method to add an extra flair to it. It smelled and tasted great. Now if only there was more meat and less fat... 

There was 2 pcs of half boiled eggs in it! Yay to bonuses =) 

The soup.. I'm 99% sure there was MSG in it. Not impressed.

Overall, I don't think I would wait an hour for this restaurant again. I'm not disappointed.. but not impressed either."
