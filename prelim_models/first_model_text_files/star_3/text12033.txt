I have been living out of the country since summer 2011, & was excited to see the new bigger location in Old Town.

I decided to go in for a meal today, & the food was still good, but not as good as I remembered. The real disappointment was the service. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in. I looked around, & decided to eat at the bar. There was an older guy behind the bar. He didn't even say hi, until someone else told him I was there. Then he started to take my order, walked off with no explanation, then came back to say they were out of it earlier, but they had it now. Ok great. I was ready to finish my order, but he walked off & greeted other customers & started telling them about happy hour. I was shocked. I reminded him that I hadn't finished ordering, & so he came back. I can honestly say I have never had an ordering situation like this before in my life. Then he never came back. Someone else ran my food out, & he seemed to be leaving for the day.

I totally get that it must have been the end of his shift, but he could have at least checked on my food & told me he was moving my tab over. He still hung out for a bit to chat with other employees, so it's not like he was rushing out. The lady who took over, was nice & gave decent service.

My bill came to just under $30 for a lemonade, one happy hour cocktail, & a chicken meal. Frankly I could get the same meal elsewhere with better service for less. It's sad to see that Lo-Lo's has become this."
