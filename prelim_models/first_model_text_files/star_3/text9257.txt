We were seated promptly by the host and received our drink orders in timely fashion, but I have to take stars away for slow food service and food quality. My husband's fish and chips was overcooked and my chicken Caesar wrap actually contained cheddar cheese, unexpected and unwelcome.

Karaoke was fun, supportive crowd and the system they were using kept everyone apprised of who was up next.

Bottom line: come to sing, not eat."
