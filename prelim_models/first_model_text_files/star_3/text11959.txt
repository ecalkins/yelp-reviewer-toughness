I've been here on several occasions, new and old location..even the one downtown several times. But, the wait for the food is the least enjoyable experience. I'm currently in here on a Tuesday evening. We initially ordered the honey hot wings, which are amazing by the way!!!! AGAIN, my issue is neverrrr with the food. The waitress had a stank attitude, probably because she wanted to go home, but if she was attentive we would have been gone 45 min ago! We've been here for an hour and a half, it's 10:30pm..they close at 10pm..smh!!! 

Before we left we ordered the peach cobbler and the banana pudding, both amazing as usual! 

Please someone get a grip on the service here though, please I beg of you. The foods amazing, don't change a thing (WITH THE FOOD..lol)"
