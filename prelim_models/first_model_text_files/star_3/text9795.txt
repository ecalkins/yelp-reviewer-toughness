This place is usually hit but sometimes miss. Of the several times we've ordered, the food has been delicious almost every time (we recommend the beachcomber scramble and blue Hawaiian smoothie) however literally almost every single time there was something wrong with our order, some small mix up (regular eggs instead of egg whites, extra cheese on the wrong dish, etc). This time we ordered two of the exact dish but one with extra chicken. They both arrived with extra chicken which is fine except there's a charge for it and we didn't want it on the second item and one arrived with the toast and potatoes it's supposed to come with and the other one inexplicably just didn't, the sides just weren't there. This type of thing is just extremely annoying but not worth complaining about and waiting for the correct food to arrive.

That's the next thing... The wait. They say the food will be there in 45 minutes to an hour but it's almost always 30 minutes late (takes about an hour and a half) like it was today. On the upside, it arrives very fresh with the food hot and smoothies still frozen.

There is only one time that was an absolute disaster. We didn't eat more than a few bites of any item. We aren't sure if this was due to our food choices as we had tried some new things off the menu or if it was due to whoever was cooking that day. Everything was soggy and tough. Blech.. 

In the end, we keep ordering from here so it's obviously not that bad. It's usually delicious, just a little mixed up and late. If they fixed those two things and were open a little later for us night owls it would probably be perfect."
