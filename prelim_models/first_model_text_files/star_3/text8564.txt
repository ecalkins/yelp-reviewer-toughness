0	Late dinner after a show . One block east of strip. We had to wait to get into BBQ. But that was OK, played slots and won the cost of dinner ,plus a coupon!. Once we got seated and ordered. The food arrived pretty fast. I had half & half (chicken & ribs). It came with beans, corn, & garlic toast. Very tasty & very chewy! Will repeat !
