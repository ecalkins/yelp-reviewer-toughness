We were seated in a booth in the back. We signed up for the players club and got to spin the wheel for free points (I got 2,500 =$2.50) l, prizes (sis got free beer) & a coupon for $9.99 steak. DO NOT PRINT IT OUT! they have good specials on 8oz New York steak, eggs, fried potatoes and toast for only $6.99. 

We ordered two of the steak specials and a prime rib ($14.99). My prime rib came with green beans and choice of a side, I got mashed potatoes and soup or salad. I gave my cream of broccoli soup to my sister and she said it was pretty good. I ordered a prime rib done medium and it came out medium well, it was still very soft and tasty though! Lots of fat, but a huge portion. I had half left over to take home. 

I'll have to agree with other reviews that the food & service here is very inconsistent. 

Come here on a weekend from 9am-2 pm to get a Bloody Mary right in front of the cafe. It's build your own for ($7). They put whatever you want in it, and they use titos vodka. Ours had a bacon strip, a pickle, olives, limes, a piece of chicken & waffles. It was VERY good."
