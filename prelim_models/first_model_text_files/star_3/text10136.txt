However, you only get two pieces of pork belly per bowl which is very little for my standard. 
I'll give ramen 4/5 stars. 
you always need to line up at this restaurant because of limited space. Also even I haven't finished the noodles, the waitress kept coming and wanted to take away my noodles, which was very impolite to me. They should improve their customer service!"
