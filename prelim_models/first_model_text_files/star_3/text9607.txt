I suggest getting a side of the out of this world blueberry pancakes. The are fluffy and packed with blueberry and the flavor actually reminds me of birthday cake. Thumbs up beach cafe, thank you for feeding me on my way to a 14 hours shift!!

Unfortunately since my last review the food quality has gone a little downhill. On my last visit , my wife and I came in for our favorites a stack of blueberry pancakes and my island scramble and for her the Hawaiian burger with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. This time around my scamble was missing the flavors that I became accustomed to. It was pretty bland so I skipped ahead to my favorite pancakes. I was very upset when my light fluffy delicious cakes ended up being wayyyyy too sweet and were crunchy. As for my wife's burger , it was over cooked the pineapple was soggy and they forgot the teriyaki sauce. As they did bring her a side of sauce, it ended up being extremely salty. I have never tasted a teriyaki sauce so salty and yet so thin. It ran and tasted more like a soy sauce with a sugar packet dropped in it. I want to give it another chance , but paying $40 for two meals that were hardly edible. Not going to happen anytime soon."
