The place is small and not really bright, we were placed close to the kitchen so after our clothes were smelling like crazy! and it's really hot! 

The menu selection was small, i was expecting some other stuffs. So we took the pork ramen and some gyozas. 
The gyozas weren't really special kind of bland for the price. As for the ramen they were pretty tasty not too salty, pretty decent for the price. But i wasn't really amazed tho, maybe too much expectation?
My friend didn't appreciate the fact that if you ask half of the bowl you still have to pay the same price ( He's easily upset)

i would recommend this place but don't wander on the menu, just try the ramen and that's all!"
