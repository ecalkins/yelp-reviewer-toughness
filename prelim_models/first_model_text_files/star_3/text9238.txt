Ellis Island always had a soft spot in my heart for cheap food and drinks -- before karaoke was the main attraction. My brother used to take me here when he first moved to LV in the early 2000's. You can have a decent meal with a beer for under $20. Good beer, too.

I brought a few friends to Ellis Island late-ish for some food and it was OK. One of us loved it, one of us thought it was just alright, the other got a stomach ache. Guess you could call us the three bears? 

My club sandwich was fine. Nothing fancy. Plus the steak fries were pretty good. Bloody Mary's always taste better in Las Vegas, so no complaints there either. 

Definitely not the finest dining around. Questionable service and patrons at times, but not even scratching the surface in Sin City."
