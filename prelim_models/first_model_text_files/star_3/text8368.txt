Extremely rude with an ego problem, I put down about 300$ on the table lost it and kindly asked for maybe a comp breakfast(value of about 7.99) and he started to laugh. If he was polite I would have understood. But my friends have gone here and all have had a similar situation with the pit boss ruining their night.
