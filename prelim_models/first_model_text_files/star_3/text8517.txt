Some management & staff were nice however I noticed a bit of distinction in the flow of check in the lines were over 1 hour wait only to tell me no prepaid cards so I lost the booking.com  and was stranded due to the information from management prior to this arrival was that I had needed a deposit on a card so I went to 7eleven loaded my card and was turned away after waiting an hour in line. not a great look on customer service skills and the.price was not the correct amount at check in vs how much the actual price was on the website sheesh the room was nice once I got a bank card
