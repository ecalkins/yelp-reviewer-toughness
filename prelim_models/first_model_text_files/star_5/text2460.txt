BUT, I had to try Secret Pizza since the Yelp reviews and my friends said so. After checking it out, this hidden spot at the Cosmo is the bomb-- BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD!

If it's your first time, try the Great White. SOO GOOD! Secret Pizza's thin slice New York style pizzas use fresh ingredients and are made to order. And it's cheap for those of you who ball on a budget.

Secret Pizza's location is actually a secret for those of you first timers. The Cosmo don't have signs that will lead you to it. But all you need to do is go up to the 4th floor and go down a hallway that you can't miss. It's easy access for those leaving Marquee day/night club.

So definitely check it out. Secret Pizza set the new standard for me."
