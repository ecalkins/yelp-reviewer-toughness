Secret Pizza is truly secret...it is not listed on the Cosmopolitan website...and there are no signs around the hotel telling you where it is. You have to find the hallway of album covers...which will lead you down the path to the gloriousness that is PIZZA! (Hint: It's located on the 3rd floor of the Eastside tower.)"
