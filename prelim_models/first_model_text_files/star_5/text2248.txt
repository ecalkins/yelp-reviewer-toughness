You see a ton of swanky fancy restaurants and the best restauarant in the entire place is this hidden pizza place hidden between all these restaurants. I don't think I have to say muh about how good the pizza and this place is. All the other reviews will do it for me. Just a heads up they only do New York Style Pizza. There is no formal seating area but there is plenty of nice seating outside the actual hole in the wall. Go try it. Its Cheap, fast and good greasy food for your drinking.
