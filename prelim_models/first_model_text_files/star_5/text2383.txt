Not only was this prolly some of the best pizza my wife and I have ever had.... They have PBR on tap and serve it to you in a red keg cup. It made me feel like I was in high school again.

Now that we are home my wife won't stop talking about this ridiculous pizza.

Amaze balls go eat it now and thanks to yelpers for bringing us there."
