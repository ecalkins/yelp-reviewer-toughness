0	#2 Best NY-style Pizza I have ever had. It was not after a night of clubbing, didn't even have anything to drink yet. Combination of crust, cheese and sauce is solid. I think they source the pepperoni from the angels up above, because it is really spicy but amazing flavor that compliments the other ingredients beautifully. This is a must try for anyone staying Mid-strip, or on the strip for that matter. Enjoy, I did!!
