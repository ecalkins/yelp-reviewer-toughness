Although, like several other people have said, it is not necessarily a secret due to its location being easily accessible, I love the fact there is no advertisement for it, and finding it is kind of an adventure on its own. Besides all this, the pizza is honestly some of the best I've tasted. It really feels like I'm eating some authentic New York style pizza. Lastly, I love that it is open until i believe 4am, that way after I am done going out with friends we can always catch a slice before we head home!
