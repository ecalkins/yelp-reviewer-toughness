We got a full pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. I don't know what they do to it, but it was really tasty pizza.  Not super thin crust, but also not too thick and bready.   A good amount of toppings too.  Expensive for a hole in the wall pizza place though.  It's $30 for a large pizza and 3 toppings.
