Fill up your gas tank with some cheesy pizza. Probably not such a smart idea , but when taste is on the line,  it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make!

There was a long line out the door of a nameless restaurant and from the hints that the yelp reviews and hotel staff, we pinpointed that this was secret pizza. This was our go to spot when we were in a time crunch 'cause it was in the Cosmo next to marquee and in our hotel! I tried the white sauce pizza and just a plain pepperoni with sun dried tomatoes. Both were everything i was dreaming of. Thin, flavorful and chock-full of carbs! 

Pleas note, If you don't want something cheesy, skip the white pizza!"
