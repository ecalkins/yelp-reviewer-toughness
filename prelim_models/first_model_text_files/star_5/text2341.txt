0	The secret pizza shop is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the strip,be ready to stand in line just about anytime you show up,its open till 3am,the pizza is thin crust style,and very,very good,really its excellent!! we ate there 4 times,its more or less very similiar to what you would find in the best shops in NYC,located at the end of a small hallway,its always packed with customers,we usually ordered 2 slices each,its kind of pricey,about $5 a slice,but well worth it,the pizza reminded us of Lombardos in NYC,its that good!! Just enough cheese on these slices to keep u interested,the sauce is just right,would have to say its the best pizza we have had in vegas over the years,HINT!! its on the 3rd floor!!
