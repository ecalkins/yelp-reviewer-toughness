Came here my first night in Vegas after playing some Sigma Derby (side note: if you don't know what that is, you need to find it in the MGM Grand... it's a really fun quarter game that those of us youngsters who visit Tahoe always love to play for hours at Montbleau... old school horse racing at its simplest!) I ordered the white pizza because of all of the reviews I read about it on Yelp and bf ordered pepperoni and sausage. Both are really great! Of course it's fun that it's kind of a secret although the line would say that it was not that secret at all!
