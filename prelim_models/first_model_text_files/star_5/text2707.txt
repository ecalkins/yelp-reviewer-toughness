I hear they ship water in from nyc to make the pizzas. Plus it is New York style pizza, which I like. I love to be able to fold my slices. One of my favorite slices had sausage and pepperoncini peppers on it. The peppers really took it to another level. My wife loved it so much we went back the next day to get again. The sausage and pepperoni is good as well, but if you can get it try the one with the pepperoncini peppers
