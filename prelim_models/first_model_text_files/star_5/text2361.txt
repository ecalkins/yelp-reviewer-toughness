0	"LOCATED: on the 3rd Floor . If you find a narrow hallway surrounded by framed record album covers your in the right spot.

PIZZA STYLE: here is New York style. It is freshly made with hand tossed dough. with a excellent crispy crust.

GET: the White Pizza(Ricotta & Cheese) this one usually sells out, based on how much Ricotta Cheese they have available. 

PRICE:  is comparable to your mall pizza slices(around $5 a slice), I would order a whole pie since the price is $24 which gives you 10 slices. Slices are pretty decently big. But, your going to be eating more than one slice.

OPEN LATE: Perfect spot after clubbing or late night grubbing since its open til 4am. But be prepared for a Long Line in the evening. 


""Secret Pizza"" is no longer a secret anymore"""
