Located on the 3rd level.  There isn't a sign, so look past the pool table.  This pizza joint is located down a long hallway lined with album covers.  You might be able to spot the ""Vegas"" pinball machine from outside.

It's a very small place.  Once inside, you will notice:
-A few stools and a small counter to sit at.  
-Pinball machine, and an arcade game.  
-Couple of pizza ovens.
-Pizza counter with pre-made pizzas, and a handful of toppings to choose from.
-Pizza artist and a cashier.
-Great pizza!

It's not a full dining establishment.  Pretty much order and go. You wouldn't expect much more from a place with $3 pizza slices in a multi-billion dollar resort. 

You can have extra toppings added for a small charge.  If you order a slice, it is tossed into the oven for a couple minutes and you are good to go.  Full pizza's start at $17.  Guest's of the hotel can place an order through room service. 

Feeling thirsty?  They have PBR  and Dogfish Ale on tap.  

The people who work here are great.  Real pizza artist's with personality.  

Check this place out!  It's convenient, inexpensive and open late night until after Marquee Nightclub closes."
