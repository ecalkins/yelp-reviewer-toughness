It's the perfect spot if you want cheesy, greasy, melt in your mouth type of pizza. Never a disappointment. Tried all flavors but will admit combo and garlic are my go-to's. Introduced several family and friends to this place and always a hit. Even better in the middle of the night. Convenient since it's open usually until 4AM!
