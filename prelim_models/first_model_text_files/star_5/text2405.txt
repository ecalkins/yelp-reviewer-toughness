Follow the chandelier up and then take the escalator up one level from Marquee.  Then follow your nose to the scent of PIZZA!!!!!!  (look for the hallway of vinyl)

F that! I never get just a slice here, I always buy a pie, a whole one at that!  That way you can get half red sauce and half white!  Add your appropriate toppings and voila!  Dine inside or grab a seat by the pool table outside and watch all these people looking at you eating your huge slices!  The pizza here is really good and I actually favor the white.

HOLLA!"
