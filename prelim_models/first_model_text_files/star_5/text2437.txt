There's no signage outside and it's not listed in any directories at the hotel. We asked the manager about it and he told us it started out as a small kitchen just to provide room service, but just before they opened, they decided to open it to walk ins, but made the choice not to advertise or market it. They're doing $5 million/year now. Pretty good for no marketing..... 

If you stop in, be prepared to take your slices or full pizza to go, as there is very minimal counter space set aside to eat in house. We loved it and I highly suggest stopping!"
