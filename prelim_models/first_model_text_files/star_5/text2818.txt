Thin and large slices of NY styled pizza that taste like heaven when you're drunk and hungry near Cosmo. Katie B. took the words right out of my mouth because the best part of this place is watching and talking to the inebriated individuals that have no clue what they're saying while bumping into you left and right. Entertaining? I think so. I seriously think having such a narrow and long hallway for waiting in line isn't because they want people to feel claustrophobic, it's because they want to make it easy for the confused drunk people to stand in line. Don't expect to eat inside, there are like four chairs and people standing everywhere waiting for their pizza. We tried the white pizza with ricotta and the peppers pizza. Both were delicious, but I had to remove the layer of oil sitting on the pizza. Come here for a good time and satisfy your pizza cravings while you're at it!"
