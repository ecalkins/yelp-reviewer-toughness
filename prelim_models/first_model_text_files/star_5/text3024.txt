There are no signs. It's just kind of an alleyway between some nice decor and another restaurant. The line is long, especially when the pizza doesn't come out fast enough.

BUT MY GOD. I don't know if it was because I was drunk, but OMG this was the best pizza I've had. And I've been to NYC. 

It was so tasty, so flavorful. I also love that I can add a ton of garlic powder (bc I don't want to be attracting some nasty vamp creeps at the clubs). 

Anyway, it was pretty pricey for a slice..."
