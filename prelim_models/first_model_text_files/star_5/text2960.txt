I could confidently say that this was the best slice of cheese pizza I have ever had. The crust is uh-mazing, crunchy yet soft. The sauce was yummy! I hear the white pizza is amazing, definitely going to try that next.

The line is worth it, so stick it out! I had to listen to this drunk girl for 30 minutes blab on about how she didn't sleep with the entire hockey team, but it was all worth it in the end!"
