The white pizza has three or four different types of cheeses and is smothered with roasted garlic spread.  Nothing can top this for post drinking nomz.  The only downfall is that they don't have different sizes to their pies that can be ordered.  A whole pie is 28"".  Which was enough to feed three guys and still have leftovers for two others.  This is a must have when in Vegas.  Run, don't walk!"
