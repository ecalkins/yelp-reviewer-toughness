I think I got a slice of the sausage/pepperoni and a slice of the supreme, both were phenomenal.  Amount of toppings is generous and the pizza slice was huge and greasy (good greasy).  

The wait can be a while after getting out of Marquee (30 min), but it's well worth the wait!!!!  It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo Casino  I don't even know you whoever you are reading this review, but I hope that you will get the chance to enjoy this miraculous pizza.  I can't wait to go back and get it again!!"
