After clubbing at Marquee, there is a super long line, just be patient, you'll make it to the front.  My pizza slice was very good, ate it like I haven't eaten before.

What I like about this specific place, was the hallway of album covers.  Made the time pass by looking at them.  Great conversational pieces."
