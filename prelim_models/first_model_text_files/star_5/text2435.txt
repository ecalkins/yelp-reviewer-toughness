Best pizza in Vegas, perfect Brooklyn style, delicious crust, melty gooey cheese. I've been probably a dozen times since the Cosmo opened and only once has it not been the best thing ever.  Go ahead and bring a friend or two and order a whole pie because a slice only leaves you wanting more.  Plus the people watching is great, especially the nights Marquee is open and all the clubgoers  are standing in line getting pizza at 3 AM.  Also, I've seen Nelly and other celebs there before too so it's not just us little people that like the pizza hehehe"
