I wish I had known about this place sooner.  Its really tucked away in some alley within Cosmopolitan.  There you will find some old school arcade games, a few places to stand around and eat, and of course, the best damn pizza you'll find in Las Vegas, and that's for sure!  The toppings are just oozing with perfection, and the crust is really gives this ol' pie some bite.  Just the right amount of crunch!  You've got to try this place whenever you're in town. Here I am craving one right now, sitting in my house, 200 miles away."
