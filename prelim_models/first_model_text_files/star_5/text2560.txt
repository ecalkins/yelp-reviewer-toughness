 My friend and I waited around 1pm and it took about 15-20 minutes to get our pizza with 3 people in front of us. The guy was also busy making pizza for a large group order. It was cool to see the guy making pizza. He didn't toss the dough. He just flatten and pushed out. 

The pizza was really good. Crisp pepperoni surrounded by oozing cheese and perfectly seasoned sauce on a crispy crust. Delicious! 

Another friend went at 1am and it took almost an hour for him to get a slice of pizza. He didn't care for the pizza too much. 

It's about $3/slice for cheese and $3.50/slice for one topping.  Great price for dining. Limited seats inside but a lot more outside."
