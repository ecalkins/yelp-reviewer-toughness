This review wont be long I swear...because I want you guys to just find this place....on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan...exit out the elevator to your left...then quickly to your right...spot the hallway after the Jaleo Restaurant and make a right down the hallway..... and see the glorious yet tiny SECRET PIZZA place. It's everything your heart desires. Whatever you want, order it- This place is where dreams come true. I was craving a good pizza place, absent of the fancy Vegas pretentiousness and I found it. Made to order. Orgasmic. You gotta do it guys...
