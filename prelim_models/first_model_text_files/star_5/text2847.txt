Everyone knows it's there and I usually always get a slice or two when I have an appointment in the east tower and that makes going to the cosmo for any reason that much better. Secret pizza is a must stop for everyone so plan on standing in the line for a few minutes. You'll realize that it was time well spent with in your first bite.
