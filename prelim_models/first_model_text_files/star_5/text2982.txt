The first time I had Secret Pizza was coming out of Marquee Nightclub, drunk. Usually at that time, there's a longggg line of drunk people. The pizza here is sooo good though, you really don't mind the wait.

They have several toppings ready. You tell them which one you want and they heat it up. The pizza is thin crust and heated to perfection.

Now this is not just a place to go when you're drunk. Went around 12pm just a little after they opened and was still super good! They also have ample amounts of seasonings to sprinkle on your pizza - cheese, red chili flakes, oregano, and GARLIC! 

Love coming here when I'm craving pizza and it's right on the strip in Cosmopolitan!"
