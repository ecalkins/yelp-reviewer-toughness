There was not a long line (just about 5 people in front) when I went (around 7:30PM). A friend of mine recommends me the place cause she knows what Vegas is all about! It took a long time to make the whole pizza pie for 3 people to share though (35 mins), but it was definitely worth the wait. Waiting was not so hard, it's good to walk around and do something else around (gamble). ;) 

The pepperoni and meatball are delicious toppings, and the center of the pizza was magnificent. That first bite has the perfect ratio of tomato sauce and cheese, then as you eat towards the crust more cheese! The dough was so good that I ate everything! I normally don't eat the crust but it was really that good to me. 

I'm not a huge critic on pizza like I don't really pay so close of attention to how they make it, but I have eaten pizza around NYC like Grimaldi's and Lombardi's. I have a bigger heart for this place. :)"
