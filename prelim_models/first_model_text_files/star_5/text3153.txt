Well being when I stayed in the Cosmo for two night, I had Secret Pizza 4 times within 48 hours.  Maybe it was the dough or the awesome staff which kept me coming back but I was sold on the first bite.  I love NY style pizza and all the way in the desert thousands of miles from NY, NY, come a slice secretly made with imported NY water.

Try the white slice and tipping big helps you skip through the line.
