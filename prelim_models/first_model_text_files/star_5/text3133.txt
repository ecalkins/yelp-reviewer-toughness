Take a gamble and go searching for Secret Pizza. I've heard all the hulabaloo and thought, well, it's not so secret now is it?! Well, yeah, it is a damn good secret to be found. And well worth ""the search""...

I was no mood to be searching for Secret Pizza. So thank goodness my Yelp friends are not as mysterious as the blank rectangle on my Cosmopolitan hotel map. After reading through some tips & reviews, I found the long, mysterious hallway - ok, well, I lied, I just followed my nose and smelled the pizza deliciousness wafting down the corridor. Thankfully, there was no line and five pies to choose from. Hubby and I chose the White Pizza and a Combo slice. I must say, the White Pizza is the way to go. I'm pretty sure my husband was bummed that I suggested we try two because he would've loved to eat that White Pizza slice all by himself. Don't get me wrong, both were excellent choices, but the White Pizza is a mouth explosion. 

Besides the pizza, I'm thrilled to share with you that they offer all-you-can-drink FREE filtered water. Yup, #waterfanatic here and trust me, that water was YUMMMMM.  So, fill er' up!

My advice: 
YES, check out Secret Pizza
No, don't wait until 2 or 3am
YES, go at lunchtime - there was little or no line
No, don't go looking for signage - there is none
YES, you know you've found it when you see pinball machines
No, don't plan on sharing
YES, #alwayshydrate (free filtered water FTW!)"
