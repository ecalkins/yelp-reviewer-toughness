Two things I know about this place is its a pain in the but to find and the pizza is spot on! The title Secret Pizza is definitely true. We had to ask two people where this place was located because there is no sign and no big window. It literally looks like a janitor hallway with a PAC MAN machine at the end. Once you walk to the end of the hallway it opens up into what seems like the smallest pizza kitchen ever. But what this place lacks in size it sure makes up for in pizza and the size of the slices. It seems you may need to custom order your pizza if you don't want pepperoni or just cheese. But I assure you it'll be worth it. I got two slices of pizza and although I was satisfied I probably could have crushed another one in no time. A bonus that I found is that they serve beer and have oregano and Parmesan shakers all around. So not only did I powder my pizza but I got two brews to go. At 9am. Don't judge. It's Vegas.
