Just go all the way in and it looks like a quick stop pizza shop like in New York. It was $4.50 per slice and I haven't had New York style pizza this good since I was last in New York!! The thin crust and the super-elongating-cheese-when-you-bite-into-it-just-like-in-the-movies is heaven! 

I love how this is open late and we just came out of Marquee and satisfed our late night cravings. For being surrounded by $$$$ restaurants, this place is awesome. Thank you Cosmo for giving at least one cheaper food option. 

Only con: very limited seating in there (maybe like 6-8 stools). You have to go outside and eat. My friend and I just ate on the couches by the pool tables."
