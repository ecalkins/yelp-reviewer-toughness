Was giving friends the good ole' Las Vegas Strip tour and decided to give this place a try as I had heard many good things from fellow Yelpers. Staff was really friendly and even suggested we get a pie instead of ordering slices as there was 4 of us (probably would have figured it out on our own but its nice to know they weren't trying to pinch us for every penny).

Did I mention that it had that ""aroma""? You know, the aroma of a genuine pizza place? If you are from New York, you know about the ""aroma"". I was sold the second I started walking down that entrance way.

Pizza was very good and the ingredients were quality. No joke, but some of the best tasting pepperoni I have ever had. We had a half white, half pepperoni pie.

Only downfall for me was that the middle of the pie got a bit soggy. Maybe it was the type of pie we ordered, I don't know. But outside of that, I was extremely pleased and despite the price tag (around 25 bucks) it's worth it for good quality product."
