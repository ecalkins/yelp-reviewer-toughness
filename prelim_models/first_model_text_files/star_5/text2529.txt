Anyways, it wasn't very hard to find since my group and I knew where to look and what to look out for. Thanks, Yelp.

When we got there, there were only 4-5 people waiting for their pizza to be made. My sister and I ordered the 18in white pizza. It only took like 10-15 for them to make it. And I'm gonna assume that my experience ordering a whole pizza fresh was better than choosing a slice out of the pies that were already made in the window. 
 
We took the pie back to our hotel and oh my goodness! I could taste it now just thinking back to it. I have never had a white pizza before, and I am never going back. It was hot, fresh, and HUGE for like $20. It was so soft (but not fall apart soft) and so cheesy. The ricota was a nice touch. 

Everything about it was perfect and the ingredients were so simple. You have to stop here when you're in Vegas."
