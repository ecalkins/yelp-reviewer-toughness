There was a small line in the afternoon around 1ish? Nothing crazy tho. Got two slices of the great white, one pepperoni, and one sausage. The total came out to be about $17, and we realized we should have just gotten a whole pizza for a couple bucks more. The great white was BY FAR the BEST PIZZA I've ever had in my entire life.
