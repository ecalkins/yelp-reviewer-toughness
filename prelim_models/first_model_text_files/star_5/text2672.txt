Nestled in a hallway at the Cosmoploitan reminds me of finding those little secret joints in New York.....so is this where they got their idea from.....cuz if so it's working....people lined up...the smell of the best darned pizza I've ever had, and the nicest staff a girl could ask for. I really did not think I would like it as I really have not found a good pizza joint in Las Vegas (well to my likeing anyway, and when it comes to food I'm a tough cookie). So off I go into this pizza culinary dream joint only to find that they have veggies...lots and lots of veggies (yup I'm a vegetarian). This is one reason I thought I may not like it.... The staff assured me that I can get almost any veggie known to man if I would wait a minute while they ran to room service to get the ones most people don't eat on a pizza. What a concept! Yes guys you can order pizza to your room after a long night at Marquee...just call room service and they will hook u up....Between the quaintness of the hidden pizza joint and being able to order it from room service I see a winner....now can we get a chain of these across the us PLZZZZZ??????
