Once you exit the elevator you walk straight out and you'll see a tiny alley way on your right. There are no signs. This place is not listed in the directory. It is truly a ""secret pizza"" place. Walk down the alleyway and it will lead you to the best kept secret in Las Vegas!

Once you get inside you will notice it is a very small place. There's no waiter service. There's very little room for you to sit and eat. You might think to yourself ""WTF? This is just like any other hole in the wall pizza joint"". But don't let that fool you! 

This was my first time here. I only came here upon my friend's recommendation. I decided to skip the fancy buffet to try something new. When I first walked in I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a large fancy pizza place. I thought to myself ""why is this place so popular?"". There were no signs that said ""we're famous for blah blah blah"". So I asked the employee what they were famous for. The guy told me this place is famous for it's ""White Slice"".

I recommend getting the white slice with pepperoni. The original white slice itself will not come with any meat or toppings. The flavor and taste of the white slice is quite unique. It is something other pizza places do not offer. It is a taste unlike any I've ever tasted before. If I had to describe it in words I would say cheesy, garlicky, and damn good! All I can say is you have to try it to believe it. After the first bite I understood why this place is so great when it comes to pizza."
