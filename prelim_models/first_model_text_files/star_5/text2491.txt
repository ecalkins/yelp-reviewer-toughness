It's kind of a secret, not really. But it can be hard to find after the club if you're not too familiar with its location beforehand. THIRD FLOOR OF THE COSMO.

Bf and I circled the 2nd floor a few times before I went back on Yelp to figure it out where it was. Once we found out it was on the third floor, it was easy to find with the seating area full of used plates and napkins and a loud group of drunk people waiting in line at 4AM (the photos on Yelp should help you figure out which hallway it is). The line was pretty long, but good company always makes it bearable.

White pizza is definitely where it's at. Getting a whole pizza with a larger group is definitely better. 

There isn't much room inside to sit and eat comfortably, but the seating area right outside the hall isn't too bad. 

During the daytime, there wasn't much of a line and wasn't as chaotic. Had it sober and it was still a delicious pizza. At $5 a slice, it's probably the reasonably, deliciously priced item in Vegas. 

Secret Pizza is a MUST-TRY when you're in Vegas and especially after the club."
