I believe that good pizza is very hard to find. It's one of those foods that is often made to be a quick cheap fix, and I find myself calling the majority of the pizza I eat average. I'm rarely ever wowed by a slice of pizza and I've grown accustomed to that. When I heard about all the praise this pizzeria was getting I was a bit skeptical, but I will let you know that all that praise is very, very well deserved.

You need to go on a bit of a hunt to find the pizzeria at the Cosmo. They don't advertise it, you wont find any signs pointing you in its direction, and they don't even mention it on their website. It's located down a random hallway on the third floor nestled next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar. It's a very small pizzeria with only a few stools for sitting and eating. They don't even have a menu. It's all about the pizza here.

The sauce is delicious, the toppings are delicious, and the crust is delicious. This pizza is delicious! It's made New York style with the floppy pizza that needs to be eaten taco style. The sauce has the perfect amount of flavor to accompany the toppings without being overwhelming or becoming overwhelmed. You can tell that the sauce is fresh along with the toppings. They don't have the largest selection of toppings but the ones that they do have are fresh and beyond tasty. The crust is just the right consistency and is one of those crusts that you wont mind eating the ends of the pizza. It all comes together to make the best pizza in town that I have tried so far. It is a bit pricey when compared to other pizza places but you pay for the quality. 

I can't stress enough about how good this pizza is. It is one of the very few pizzas that has been able to wow me. If you want to taste how a real pizza is supposed to taste like go to the Pizzeria at the Cosmo."
