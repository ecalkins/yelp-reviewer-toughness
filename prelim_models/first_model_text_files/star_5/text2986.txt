I don't think you can get a better slice anywhere west of the Mississippi. Trust me I have tried. I don't really have a favorite so try what looks good to you. I promise you will like it. Only downside is the line and wait if you to get a full pie. This rates as easily on my top 5 best pizza places I have ever tasted, if you can find it.
