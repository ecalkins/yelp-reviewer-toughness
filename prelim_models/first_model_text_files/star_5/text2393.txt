The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2 a slice, and an additional 1,50 for sea salted chips. 

However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds. 

Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! x"
