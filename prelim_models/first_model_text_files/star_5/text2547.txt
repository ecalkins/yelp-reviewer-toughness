Marketing genius by the folks that conceived the Cosmo- an off website, late night, by the slice, pizza parlor that has generated far more buzz through word of mouth than if ever listed on their website.  Stopped by around 2 am one recent Friday night and found the line out the door! (There's no sign but it's on the 3rd floor, near the front of the hotel- just look for the crowd or find the spot between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon.)

Service is fast and prices are reasonable for Vegas.  If they don't have the exact blend of toppings you want, just ask and they will throw it together on the spot."
