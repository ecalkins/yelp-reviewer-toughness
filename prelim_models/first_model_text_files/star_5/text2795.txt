The wait is around 30 minutes to an hour. But, SO worth it especially after a night of drinking. There's not much seating inside. 

The pizza literally melts in your mouth. Even thinking about it makes me salivate at the moment. We got half veggie, half meat pizza ($36).The veggie side far surpassed my expectations. The vegetables they used meshed well with the cheese. And, the meat side was bomb as expected. I'm definitely coming back again."
