You can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice. Recently they even had a deep dish version of the white slice, looked awesome but a bit much for me. You could also add toppings to all he slices and they will stick it in the oven for you.  

My go-to slice is simple: white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world. The only thing I would recommend they change would be to add fresh chopped garlic to their menu.  I made the mistake of getting 3 whole pizzas with extra garlic, only to find they use powered garlic which left an awful aftertaste in my mouth."
