If your leaving the club and craving some pizza and you think ""Hey...I think it might be fun to go find secret pizza"" and you haven't went back to your hotel to take your heels off....go sit down evaluate your life and try again. My friends and I were leaving some club at MGM and we considered taking a cab to the cosmopolitan wouldn't be too bad so we can go grab some of this infamous pizza. MAN!! First tell the driver what side of the hotel to drop you off on (I believe SP is on the east side of the hotel we got dropped off on the west, correct me if I'm wrong) after a trip on the escalator and a ride on the elevator we finally got to the floor. As soon as you hit the 3rd floor you smell pizza and lovely garlic aromas but you can't see where it's coming from. So like hounddogs in stilettos we painfully inched to this secluded hallway and found the motherland. 

It felt like a piece of NY in Vegas. I ordered a vegetarian pizza (only because my feet were hurting I was impatient and didn't feel like waiting for a pepperoni to be cooked) and it was worth every step I took to get there. The service was fast and prompt.  The pizza was gooey and greasy and cheesy. The slices were huge for five bucks. Definitely coming back!! (Next time in flats)"
