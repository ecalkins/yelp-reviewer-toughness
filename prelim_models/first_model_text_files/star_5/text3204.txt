0	Thankfully we were told about Secret Pizza, because It is actually hard to find, and very hidden. We were craving food, and I had the secret in.  Thankfully we were highly motivated at 4:30AM  to get food (aka, to sober up). Thankfully, we also were staying in the Cosmo... so basically everything was meant to be. The line for secret pizza was VERY long at 4:30, but it moved fast, and it is worth every second of the wait, drunk or not . It has a funky vibe with a long hallway lined with tons of records.  They have lots of fun pizzas, but I would suggest just going with the slices. THE BEST pizza I have had in a long time, and that isn't just saying it as a drunk pizza.
