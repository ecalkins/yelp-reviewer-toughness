Exactly, my thoughts!

What makes it more fun is that it's known as ""secret pizza"" and it's like $4 a slice. Dude, $4 isn't even gonna get you water in Marquee!

The guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober.
One of 'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, ""the sunset.."" Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing*

Even though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It's sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good.

In fact, I was debating on writing this review because I don't wanna tooo many people to crowd my fave food spot in Cosmo. But, this was too good not to share!"
