The wait was about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad considering there was a lot of entertainment (aka drunk people interacting with each other ). Between me and the boyfie we ordered 4 different slices. We ordered the white pizza, the mushroom pizza, the veggie pizza, and I think the margherita. My least favorite was the white pizza and the FAVORITE was the mushroom pizza. I loveeeee the thin breading and perfectly cooked crust here. There's a few couches outside of this place, but other than that you're better off taking your pizza back to your hotel. I  am extremely impatient when it comes to food and hanger, so of course we ate them all right then and there :) Pretty sure the drunchies made the pizza taste that much better, but I'd definitely give this place a try when I'm sober too. Me loves pizza!

It was a mission to find this place because there's absolutely no signs. Just navigate towards Milk or Momofuku and you'll be set."
