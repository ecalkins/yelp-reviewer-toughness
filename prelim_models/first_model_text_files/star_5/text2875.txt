Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, in front of the Marquee exit. My first bite of their white pizza was just... *BOOOOOM*. Unexplainable, chees-y, garlic-y goodness. The entrance, without any discernable signs, ""could"" be mistaken for a line to a bathroom. But you cant really miss the club-goers carrying out their whole pie or eating a slice as they lounge on the sofas. I mean.. come on. Hence, the lines/wait can get a bit long. 

Ever since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.  I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice. It is safe to say I am HOOKED and hands-down my favorite pizza place in Vegas, or even LA for that matter. (suggestions for great neapolitan pizzas in the greater LA area are welcome!!!!)

FYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO. 
The Salad is pretty good too so.. if there are any vegetarians/someone on a diet in the group.. well there you go.
and OMFG WTF I cannot believe I forgot about the peppers. They have the best pickled peppers so you must ask them for some.. a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, omy~ YUMMMMMMM

I cannot wait to go back to Vegas!! Good thing there are a ton of Bachelorette parties coming up. :)"
