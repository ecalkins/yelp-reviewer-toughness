That is how I felt when I took my first bite of Secret Pizza. This is one of the main reasons I came to Vegas.  Cheese drag, fat juicy chunks of sausages, and pepperoni that was to die for.

Secret Pizza really had it all. The mystique of not being formally mentioned anywhere inside of the hotel, a cool hallway of music records to give it a chic and classic kind of feel, sports playing on a TV in the corner, and the delicious pizza to go with it.

On the real, though, I don't think there's any way I would've been able to find this place on my own if The Empress hadn't been there before and led me there herself. But, that's Secret Pizza's whole thing, isn't it? I think it's pretty cool! It makes the place feel almost a little exclusive. 

Onto the food! The pizza was phenomenal. I mean, I'm by no means any pizza expert or anything, but I do know that that was the best pizza I've ever had; hands down (and I've been to Chicago, folks). The pizza that I had wasn't even a freshly baked one. It was from a hot plate and then put back into the oven for a few minutes. That's how good it was! The cheese, as mentioned above was oh so stringy. Legitimately the most stringy cheese that I have ever had on a pizza, and I loved it. The sausage on the pizza was also just amazing. They were the largest chunks of Italian sausage that I've had on a pizza before, and they were just as flavorful as they were large. Even the crust was nice and perfectly crisp, but soft at the same time. The pizza was spectacular.

To say that Secret Pizza lived up to my expectations would be an understatement. The only thing that bums me out about any of it is that I'm lactose intolerant and could only bring myself to go get pizza there once in the few days that we were in Vegas.

If you can manage to find Secret Pizza, then I absolutely suggest that you make a point of stopping by to get the same experience I did. You won't regret it!"
