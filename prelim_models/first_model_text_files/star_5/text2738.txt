What I loved most was that staple flavors, like pepperoni, cheese or veggie, were just what you'd expect but SO flavorful! 

The white pizza was amazing. No sauce - mozzarella dotted with heaps of herbed ricotta, slathered with a buttery garlic sauce. 

The sausage with onion and green peppers was perfect too. Spicy, thinly-sliced Italian sausage made for some perfect bites. 

Love this place. Highly recommended for any time of the day!"
