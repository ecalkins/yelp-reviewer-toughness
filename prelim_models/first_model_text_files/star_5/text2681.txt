It's some of the best true New York style pizza I've had. The slices was large and foldable with excellent crust. The fresh mozzarella was great as was the pepperoni. Everything had a strong & delicious taste. 

Thus, down a hallway on the third floor of a Vegas shopping center, I found the best pizza I've had outside of New York & Italy."
