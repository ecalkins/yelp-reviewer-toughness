True New York style pizza-dare I say maybe even better than the slices I had recently in the Big City.  The size of the slice, the thin crust, the pepperoni was flavorful, there was just enough cheese and sauce - there was even just enough grease to make it a bit messy and gooey.  It was the perfect combination of everything that makes pizza great.

My husband is a native New Yorker and believes he knows his pizza (true to the arrogant New York stereotype) and even he said it was simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.

Perfect slice - starting at $5 per slice.

Sodas are waaaay overpriced ($4 per cup). A bit much for me so I'll be bringing a water bottle or a soda from the vending machine. I just can't do it!!"
