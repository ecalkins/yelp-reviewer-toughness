Although it is hidden, it's not too hard to find at all.  Located on the third floor through a hall way full of records.  If you look directly in the hall way you should see a TV and a pin ball machine.  

They serve pizza by the slice or whole pizzas.  My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.  We got pepperoni, meat ball, sausage, ricotta cheese, and banana peppers on the side.  Cost was $29.  We took it outside and devoured it shortly.  Sitting next to the pool table on the couch.  We added crushed red peppers, parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.  It was so tasty and good.  Yes it's thin crust, and after pulling the slice apart, the cheese stretches and the toppings at the tip falls off.  Greasy but tasty, if grease is a problem you can use a napkin to dab at it.   

This has now become a must come to spot every time we come to Vegas."
