We got a 3 topping pizza: pepperoni, meatball, and mushroom. $26. The pizza was delicious, the sauce was perfectly seasoned, if only they give you a side to dip your crust in! It is a thin crust pizza, but not too thin and crispy, very enjoyable to eat. The place is hard to find, it is on the 3rd floor I think down a hallway... when they say 'secret pizza' it really is secret, they don't even have their name on anything! If you have the chance and are craving pizza... this is definitely the place to go!!
