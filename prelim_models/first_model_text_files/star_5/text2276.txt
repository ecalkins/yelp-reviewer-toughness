I consider myself a pizza snob and I am shocked to share that this was the best pizza I have ever eaten, no exaggeration! Their menu is very simple, as it should be. They make New York and Sicilian-style pizza that melts in your mouth. The crust of the Sicilian is airy and has a garlic buttery taste. Bonus, the guys behind the counter are nice and helpful.
