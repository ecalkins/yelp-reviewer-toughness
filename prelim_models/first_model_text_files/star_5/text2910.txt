We came to Secret pizza a few months ago so hard to find and i was in the mood to eat pizza that doesnt happen just like that if you know me you know i take care of myself :D but when i eat bad watch out .

This past months ive been having problems with some allergies reactions so when i told that to the crew of Secret pizza they inmediately contAct the person who knew more about the ingredients , i was blown away with such an amazing service i wish i could remember their names but this people work so hard to make you happy .

We shared like 4 or 5 slices and wishing i could remember the names of them but each one was great . Loveee going to restaurants with variety thats what Yelp its for :D"
