Went to try this place on our last night in vegas after the edc turn up & was not disappointed. Normally I'd be a bit annoyed I had to wait around 30 min for 1 slice of over priced pizza buuuuuut it was worth it ! The slice is big & the flavor is bigger. If I hadn't been dying & in recovery mode from that weekends shenanigans you can bet I would have bought a whole pizza just for myself. 

Every time I'm in vegas you'll find me waiting in that line at some point ! The location is written in some of these reviews but it was way more exciting to look for it on our own ! It's not hard, just follow the pizza trail :)"
