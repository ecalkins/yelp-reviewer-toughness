We stumbled in here after a night of drinking on the strip. The line was about 45 min long but I don't regret waiting at all.

We ordered two slices of white pizza. The cheese was gooey, chewy and piping hot. Basically everything you could ever ask for in a slice. We tried to buy the entire pizza but they told us we'd have to wait 20 more min so we decided against it.

Great pizza joint!"
