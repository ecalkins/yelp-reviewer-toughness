Attractive employees? No.  Attitudes?  No.  *Fast and efficient?  Yes.  Classy?  No (red cups, Pabst Blue Ribbon, boxed wine).  Friendly?  Yes.  Relatively cheap?  Yes.

If you have trouble finding it, take the escalators to the 3rd floor and ask any of the neighboring establishments and they'll point you in the right direction.

Manufactured aura aside, the NY style pizza is one of the best I had.  In fact, buddies and I came here on 3 different occasions within a span of 12 hours.  Slices are served scorching hot so be prepared to scrape the roof of your mouth if you're famished and can't wait.  Trust me, well worth the 2nd degree burns.  

*If you don't want to wait more than 15 minutes, pick from the selection there or call ahead and order a whole pie.  Counters only, no seats but plush love seats are available about 15 yards away."
