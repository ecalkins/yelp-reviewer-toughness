This place is tricky to find since there are no signs (hence the name) but well worth the trip to visit when you are hungry, FYI its on the 3rd floor of the cosmo hotel. Simple set up, counter, order, pay, eat/leave. They have thin crust(i guess a ny style) pizza as well as a Sicilian style option. During my visit stuck to the ny style pepperoni and  white pizza. Both were delicious, thin and perfectly crispy as i prefer. The service here was friendly and fast, the line here gets long but it moves steadily. For late night eats this is one of my absolute favorite places in las vegas.
