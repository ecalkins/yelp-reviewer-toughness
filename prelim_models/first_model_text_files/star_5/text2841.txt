0	The Secret Pizza place at the cosmopolitan is worth the wait! You first walk or wait in this cool hallway with all kinds of things to stare at. If your lucky you can wait for only 5 minutes. The pizza is really yummy and you can just eat inside the joint or outside by the pool table. There's also some pinball and arcade games. To get to the Secret Pizza Place you just go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan and walk through this hallway with no sign above it.
