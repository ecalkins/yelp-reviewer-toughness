It's called Secret Pizza because there's no flashing lights and a million advertisements pointing to the place. Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.

The wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right."
