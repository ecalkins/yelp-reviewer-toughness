The boyfriend and I were walking up and down the strip and were hella craving pizza. So thank you people of Yelp! I didn't get to take any pics of my pizza because I was so hungry. Only con I would say is my crust was very tough so my pizza must have been sitting out there longer than the other toppings. Oh wail. We shall return!!
