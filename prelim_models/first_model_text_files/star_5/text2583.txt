0	SO GOOD after a night of drinking... Or anytime!! It's a little pricey but it's definitely worth it! The white pizza is so good!! There aren't any toppings on it but the sauce is so good and creamy!! The combo pizza is also really good! Has olives, pepperoni, sausage, onions, etc. You can get it by the slice or a whole pizza(to enjoy with your friends in the hotel room)! Sometimes the line can get long but you should wait!! You won't be disappointed.
