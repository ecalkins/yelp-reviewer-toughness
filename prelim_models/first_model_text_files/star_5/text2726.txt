First time around I got a slice of the pepperoni and meatball... delicious! The second time I got a slice of the White pizza. So cheesy, creamy and garlic-y! The pizza itself is on the thin side, but it's so crispy and delicious. I never eat crusts on pizza, but I ate these crusts! Server Marc Anthony was great and super helpful. There is limited seating, but it's all good. Will for sure be coming back!!
