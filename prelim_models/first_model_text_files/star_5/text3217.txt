Each time I visit The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas I find an excuse to grab a slice of the hotels best kept secret. If your a fan of white pizza it's a must order here. The slices are pretty big and the accents of some of the employees are even better. Will I return... Heck yes! 

(Directions you ask? 3rd Floor Boulevard Tower but you didn't hear that from this Elite! Capiche?)"
