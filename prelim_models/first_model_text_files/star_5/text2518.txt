This is one of Vegas' hidden gems.. literally. 

Head to the 3rd floor. and look for a pool table and then follow the most innocuous hallway down until you smell a slice of heaven.. and you will smell it.

Wow is all I can say.. no signs and no frills with this spot. A great selection of different kinds of pizza's greets your eyes and it's one of the more difficult choices I had to make this trip.

The girlfriend and I both opted for the ""White Pizza"" which was a garlic loaf style crust with mozzarella cheese, feta and homemade meatballs. 

They have the slices made already.. and then put it through the oven for you as you order. What a novel idea (Halifax pizza shops, I am looking at you)

Just delicious.. no other way to explain it. THE Best Slice I have ever had. Just moist, flavourful bites of heaven. Nearly ordered another slice or two for the plane ride home.. that damn good.

Take my treasure map.. and find this golden treasure."
