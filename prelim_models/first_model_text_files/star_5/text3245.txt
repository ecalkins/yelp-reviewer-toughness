She had the white pizza, and I had the sausage and banana pepper.  We want back for seconds. 

It's a walk-up counter to order, and you can either get the order to go, or they have a few bar-type seats there.  After you order, they warm your slice in the oven for a few minutes, and call you out when it's ready. 

It is affordable, of good quality, with friendly and efficient service.  I will definitely return on my next visit to Sin City."
