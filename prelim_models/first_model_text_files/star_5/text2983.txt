I highly recommend ordering in advance and ordering a whole pizza to share so it's fresh and hot! Their garlic powder makes the pizza even better! We typically order the mushroom and sausage pizza. But all of it is good! 

No matter where you're staying in Vegas this is one place you have to eat at during your stay! We look forward to visiting everytime haha

But beware, especially after clubbing and everyone is getting hungry is when the line gets long. The last time we waited like 30 mins for our pizza. It is definitely worth the wait though."
