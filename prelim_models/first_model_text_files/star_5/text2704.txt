I was in Vegas a month ago, and naturally each time I travel  I look for spots that garner hype and are said to have good food.  

Well this place really is ""Secret"", as a matter of fact it really has no name.  One could say the prices are too steep, almost $5 a slice plus toppings.  But it is so worth it.

The white pizza, IMO, one of the best pizza's you could get outside of Italy.  Look I'm not food critic, I can't even cook but I know when something tastes good and this place makes great tasting pizza!"
