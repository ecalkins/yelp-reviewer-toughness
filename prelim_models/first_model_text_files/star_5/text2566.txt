After a late night of trying to get back to the hotel drunk, we suddenly find this hallway that led us to some place. We couldn't tell what it could be. I see a pinball machine and I immediately run to it with sheer joy. To our surprise we realize it's a pizza place. From there on, we never turned our backs to this fine pizza place. Thank you for existing.
