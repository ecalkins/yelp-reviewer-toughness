My last time here was Spring Break 2012. We found this place by accident. It's not clearly marked. As a matter of fact, it's just a nondescript hallway with a pinball machine at the other end. We noticed a few people walk in and out. Sometimes with a slice of pizza or without but smile on their face. 
We were like, ""What the hell?"" Curiosity got the better of us and we ventured down that dim hallway which is covered with vinyl album covers.
Lo and behold, it's a pizza place!! White tiled walls. Marble counters to stand or sit on the very few stools. 
Order by the slice ($5 and up) or a whole pie ($30+). Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is $5 a red Solo cup. IPA is $7. Only buy the soda if you are super thirsty: $4 a Solo cup. That's as bad as Disneyland, if not worse. Maybe that's a standard Strip price. 

This time, I got a White Pizza slice and hubby and I split a Cheese pie. 
OMG the white pizza is sooooooooooo gooooooood! Yummy mozzarella and ricotta cheese on sauceless crust. 
Then came the cheese pizza, hot out of the oven. Crispy, chewy crust with tangy tomato sauce and the perfect amount of mozz cheese. Yummy, gooey cheese. Heaven in a cardboard box. 
Try it. You'll love it."
