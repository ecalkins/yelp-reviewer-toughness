0	The not so secret pizza! As a pizza lover I have been here multiple times when I've come to Vegas. Great late night eats, but be prepared for a massive line. The line is more manageable during the day and pizza is still amazing even sober! You can never go wrong with a classic pepperoni, but also recommend trying the ricotta sausage pizza. Overall great pizza.
