I had the meat lovers with meatballs and peppercionnis and it was the bomb. The mushroom was just that and sort of lacking flavor, but still damn good pizza.

The slices are huge, the ingredients are fresh, the grease factor is heavy, the crust is thin and crispy. Just good luck finding it, half the fun."
