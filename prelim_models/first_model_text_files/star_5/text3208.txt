Even then, the directions we received did not lead us to the restaurant but merely to the general vicinity. It's located on the 3rd floor and looks like a hallway. It has no signs, advertisements, etc. You just walk down the hallway with all the pictures on the wall and viola! A pizza kitchen! You might also spot people coming from the ""hallway"" with paper plates lined with checkerboard foodpaper. 

Excellent pizza, and at a good price, especially for Vegas. We had the pepperoni pizza and ""white slice"". Would highly recommend both. I wish I had tried the sausage and pepperoni! Enjoy!"
