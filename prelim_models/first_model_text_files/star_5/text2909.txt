Oh come on Legend of Zelda fans....you know that's comedy gold. Anyways...it's not like this place has a invisible trap door. But it's also not advertised with any signs so that's win win nonetheless. I dunno if it was the alcohol in my system but this pizza shouldn't be kept from the public...it's THAT damn good. It's probably one of the top three best pizza's I've had (outside of New York). Who would've thought that legit (brick oven) pizza could be found in Vegas? 

I think I had a slice with pepperoni, salami, and sausage...my memory's kinda fuzzy. I do know that it was a superb slice. 

PS....don't go there dressed like a bum if it's after hours. There are tons of fiiiiiiiiiiiiine women at the restaurants, bars, and clubs surrounding Secret Pizza. You've been warned."
