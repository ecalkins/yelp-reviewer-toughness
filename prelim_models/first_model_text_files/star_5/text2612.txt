And we found Secret Pizza so we hurried our butts over to The Cosmo. The narrow hallway (Vegas narrow) in between 2 big restaurants was the dead give away. There were a lot of people in there but the line went super quick. I got the pepperoni, sausage and meatball pizza. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! No wonder people say it's the best pizza!!! It REALLY is the best pizza in Vegas. It's worth any amount of time you have to wait for it. If you get there right when they open, THATS the best time to go! It's so fresh and it tastes even more amazing!!! And, best of all, the price was right!!! Pizza ranges from $4-$8 for a slice!! We've decided we're going to eat there at least twice every time we come to Vegas! Great find and perfect for people on a budget in Vegas!!!! THANKS SECRET PIZZA!!!!
