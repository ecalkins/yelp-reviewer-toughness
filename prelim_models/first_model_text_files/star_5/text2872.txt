This place is perfect for those who are staying at the cosmopolitan and perfect for those weakling laggers who cant handle their booze anymore. Why? Because its secretly and conveniently located at the upper floors of the Cosmopolitan by STK and Scarpetta. I recommend the Scillian Slize. This thick crusted bad boy is packed full of flavor and gives it that rustic taste from the oven. In my book, whatever looks more ooey and gooey with cheese is always a winner for me!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"
