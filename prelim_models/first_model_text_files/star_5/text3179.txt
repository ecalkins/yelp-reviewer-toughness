Do yourself a favor and find this secret spot after you're done partying and heading back to your room for the night! If you have a difficult time finding just ask around in the third floor..look for a mass of people coming and going from a well lit alley-like entrance/exit....especially the ones leaving with whole pies in a box!! Yum
