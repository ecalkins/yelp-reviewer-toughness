Okay this place is not on the Cosmopolitan's directory or list of restaurants but it definitely is sought after especially during the wee hours and after a night filled of alcohol and dancing. As it is a ""secret"" pizza place and not listed on the directory you gotta know someone or look here on yelp to find it (it's near estiatorio milos). Just follow the line of people out the hall. They have tons of options and all are good. Yes it's a bit pricey for a pizza place ($11 for two slices) but it's on the strip and available late night and did I mention it's good? You can even call ahead for your order. A must is their white pizza!"
