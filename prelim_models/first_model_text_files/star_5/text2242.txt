One place that I kept seeing mentioned was the ""secret pizza place."" At first I thought it was a joke since people were saying there was no sign for the actual place and were giving vague descriptions on how to get there. Once I found out this was an actual pizza place with great reviews I had to find it! I can't get enough of their pizza! I always get a slice of white and always make at least 2 trips to this place each time I visit Vegas. I did have a little problem finding this place during my last visit, even though I had been here quite a few times. My husband stayed in our room while I ventured to get pizza after several (or more) drinks. I got so lost that I just ended up going back to the room after an hour. The next day after my head was a little more clear I realized I was looking around on the wrong floor, but that was all on me LOL"
