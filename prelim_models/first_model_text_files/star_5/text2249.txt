This is a Togo only pizza joint, so don't expect to sit around with friends and eat. I think I saw 3 chairs but I think they were only there for those that were waiting to pickup their phone orders. 

Ok, so the pizza was delicious. Thin slice, with thick crust, basic toppings- cheese, pepperoni, veggie, I believe they even had a pesto pizza. If your looking to pick up a whole pie, phone ahead.

I ordered two slices and paid somewhere around $10, well worth it. Can't wait to go back. I love good, fresh pizza with real cheese and sauce, so this place met all expectations."
