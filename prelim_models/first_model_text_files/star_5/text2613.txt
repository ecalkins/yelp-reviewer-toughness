OMG this pizza reminded me of MY slices i was in PIZZA HEAVEN. i love the hallway walls covered with various albums, it took me down memory lane since i love music..when we arrive the line wasn't too long, we waited approx 30 mins. Service was fast and the staff explained the pizzas they had and were willing to answer questions. I love the cashier, she was funny and had a great personality. we came back the best day and she remembered us haha..I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!
