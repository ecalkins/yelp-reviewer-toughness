Really cool place that makes you feel as if you've stepped out of the Cosmopolitan and into any hole-in-the-wall pizza across America. The pizza was great, but the real winner for us was the cheesecake. $4.50 for a giant piece that easily feeds two hungry people. There was no line when we went (around noon on New Years Eve). The ONLY complaint was there being nowhere to sit, but even that isn't a big deal since there is seating everywhere in the Cosmo.
