ooooooooooomg...so my friend and i checked into cosmo on friday and got invited to the NCAA march madness event (w/ free food and drinks) we munched and drank away...at around 9:30 pm we got hungry, but were not in the mood for a sit down (alcohol does that to you...sigh lol) so i thought of this pizza place everyone was raving about. i asked an employee where this famous pizza place was and he leaded me the way....to pizza heaven lol.

it's on the 3rd floor right next to blue ribbon sushi...in a hallway. it's tiny and you can walk right past it and never realize what amazingness you just missed out on 

we walked in and it was so cute! it's very small probably can fit max 20 people. i got the mushroom/sausage pizza and my 
friend go tthe ricotta/garlic/mozzarella pizza. it was SOOOO GOOD totally brought back memories of NY esp the seating: most of it is standing and leaning on a table LOVE IT! it was so good i came back the next evening...what can i say i love pizza when i'm buzzed :] 

you should check it out! best pizza in town (i would even say on the west coast) and it's super cheap! $3.50 a slice? for dining in LV that's pennies...check it out you'll be so thankful you did!"
