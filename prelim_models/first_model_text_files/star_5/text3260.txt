On to the pizza - awesome.  Nice crust that is crisp on the outside.  Has a slightly tangy taste like sourdough.  Just means they let the dough rise slowly and didn't rush it like so many places do.
Cheese was nice as was the sauce.  But the main attraction for me was the pepperoni.  Nice and spicy.  And the guy put a lot on there.  Really hits the spot and a much better value than a taco for $4 or a chinese bao for the same."
