I don't know I am pretty noisy and noticed a line outside of the Cosmopolitan and wanted to know what everyone was in line for. So my crazy nosy self-got in line too!! I didn't even know what I was in line for, I just knew I wanted some too, lol. As my man and I continued to walk further and further inside of the place, I begin to smell the oregano, sauce, cheese, sausage and everything else that goes on a pie! I was in love by the first scent.  We finally got to the front and ordered four slices (2 each) and a coke. Oh my, we should have ordered a whole pie!! It was good, fresh and straight to the point if you are into a classic New York Style pizza. The customer service was on point too. Everyone there was nice, and upbeat! I love love love this place and I am happy it's a secret. Let's keep this gem a secret, everything that is a secret is always good!!!
