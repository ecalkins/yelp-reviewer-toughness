I was leaving marquee nightclub inside the cosmopolitan when a Host told me about this place because I told him I was craving something to eat and I need something greasy to cure my hangover for the next morning. He told me to find the secret pizza place and I thought he was joking at first but little did I know there's definitely was one and it was amazing some of the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas.
