That's right, there are no signs or advertisements that will assist in you finding this place.  So hopefully, you have knowledgeable foodie friends or ... just ask around.

It is a bit pricey, but I'm sure the non-sober ones don't care about price at 3 AM.  After clubbing, went back to the room (b/c we were ballin' and stayed at Cosmo), changed out of our heels, and split a large pizza between 5 girls. Sausage, mushrooms, and ricotta cheese (I think!).  Divine!  I've missed NY style pizza, and I haven't been able to find a good place back in SoCal.  The crust was light, crispy but a tad soft.  We ate it right then and there by some couches, so the cheese was so goooooey!

giiiiit it!"
