u were lost but now you're found

I can eat you by the pound

if only the lines could be smaller

then I could give you more of my dollars

why is your pie sooo good

do you use special wood

i could eat you every day

i really would if i could

i luv my pizza, my little secret

but alas...nobody could keep it....


written by,  the pizza poet....."
