Pizza was super tasty, and greasy but not too greasy. Also, my friend had serious food restrictions, and they instantly knew exactly what to do in her situation. 

Be aware that there's very little space to eat in the actual restaurant space, so many people end up taking it back out to the resort area, where there are comfy chairs and couches."
