So how do you find it? Look for the rows of vinyl records on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. Or better yet, follow the smell of cheese! 

The place is pretty small, no tables, 4 stools and a few pizzas that were premade. Each time I went, I ordered the white cheese pizza with pepperoni and meatball for $6! Each slice is pretty large so it should fill you up (think costco pizza). As for a whole pizza, it's about $30 plus.

Overall, great pizza for cheap (for the strip). A super popular place once you're done with the club!"
