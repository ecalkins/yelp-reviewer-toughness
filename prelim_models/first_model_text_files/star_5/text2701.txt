I was skeptical, but when I tasted the pizza, I was floored by the texture flavor, and chewiness of the crust. For me, the pizza is in the crust. I don't know what they put in their dough, but it is hands down the best here out of most places I've tried.

I tried both the red sauce meat lovers pizza and the white sauce. I generally like the red sauce pizza better, so preferred the red.  

I'm going to be a repeat customer for sure. Oh my gosh, it is SO good."
