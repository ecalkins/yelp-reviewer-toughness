This is more than enough to keep you satisfied. I got the sausage pepperoncini and it was delicious. My husband got a Mediterranean slice and his was even better. Right outside the restaurant there is a cute sitting area with domino shaped tables. If you go up the escalator there is a skating rink too. Enjoy your pizza while people watching or watching a movie up on the big screen. They were playing Gremlins when we were there.
