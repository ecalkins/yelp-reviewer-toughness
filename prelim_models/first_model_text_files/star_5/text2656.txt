Couple friends from Norcal haven't had the chance to try it and assured them we were definitely gettin' it in!!! 

Was late into the wee hours of the night but man the line was damn knarly! First time I went it was in the afternoon and there was definitely nothing like it was at that moment. Line was wayyyy out the hallway (which where the name Secret Pizza name empasizes) into the hotel walkway. Even with such a long line, wait didn't seem so terribly long... That always seems to be the case though when you're surrounded by good company and drunk people! 

There were six of us and at $5.25 per slice, we opted for buying a whole pie instead ($28). It was and extra 20-30 minute wait but price wise would say it's definitely worth it. We went with the White pie and you can't go wrong with a crowd favorite! Came out piping hot! But I'm sure it always does since it's always does since it's always so busy... Something about an entire pie dedicated to you that makes it taste THAT much better.

That white sauce instead of a traditional red sauce was amazinggg. That light and airy ricotta cheese crumbling all in my maofz... So good. Slices were very large and we were still left with 2 extra slices which I had very little hesitation taking since the girls didn't want to eat much since day club the next day! (Score for the dudes! haha) 

We ended up coming back the next day and was just as good even though we were no where near as sober! Highlight goes too the awesome soundtrack going on that night! Singing Phil Collins rendition of "" You Can't Hurry Love"" with a hallway of strangers was the best feeling everrrrrrr! 

Great spot to make as part of the Vegas experience!... Or to get some really good pizza :)!"
