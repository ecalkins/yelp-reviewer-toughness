Maybe because of the ricotta cheese? Not sure but it was really good. I ate this pizza when I was drunk and when I sober and both times it was good. Lines can get long so if you dont like to wait order by phone and go pick it up. I finally did that this time and bypassed the long line leading out towards the place with everyone looking at me like why is he going to the front and not waiting like us.
