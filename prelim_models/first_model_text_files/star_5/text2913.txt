We stop as soon as we're in town. During our stay and then as we leave. It's ridiculously good. Vegas prices of course but worth every penny. Especially the white pie. If you come in from the elevators in the parking garage on the west side I believe it takes you right to it on the third floor. There's a pool table and an art gallery outside of it. Has a clear elevator immediately to the right of the infamous hallway entrance. Must try."
