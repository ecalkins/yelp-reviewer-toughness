And when I say secret, I mean it. It's not listed anywhere on their directory. You just gotta believe... and you'll find it. On the 3rd floor. There's a long hallway with a bunch of pictures that lead to this unexpected treasure.

There was a small line when me and my cousins went at around midnight, but looks can be deceiving. It took 10 minutes to reach the front, and 10 minutes is a long time when you're a wee bit tipsy. Come later than midnight, and you're going to have to wait.

I decided to opt for a slice of their white pie. So cheesy and garlicky! It had a ton of cheese including ricotta. And each bite had a nice hint of garlic. Their pizza is definitely on the same level as something you'd find in New York.

Prices are a bit on the higher side, but honestly, it's worth it. They also offer to bake off a whole pie for you if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes.

No, there's no place to sit, but there's places to stand and eat your pizza. It adds to the experience, I swear.

I can't wait to grab another slice of their white pie when I'm back in town."
