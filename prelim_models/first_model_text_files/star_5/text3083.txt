Their pizza is really good and the people working here are always super friendly and happy, nice job guys, you make this place what it is.  Well, along with the best pizza around.  A slice and a glass of wine for about $10.... heaven.  (Can you bring back the water dispenser though???).  :-)

Maybe we should start giving it terrible reviews so that the lines are shorter and it is a secret again."
