So excited to see and smell the wonderful pizza they had over here.  They also have beer, cannolis, and cheesecake.  The pizza is priced affordably for where you are and what you get.  They have a little bar with some stools so you can eat inside there.  It is open late too so its perfect for that late night snack.  Love the pizza, may be my favorite in town.
