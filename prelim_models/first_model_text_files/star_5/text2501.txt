It is kind of hidden, but everyone knows about it. I am from NYC, so I consider myself a good judge of pizza. I have been to some of the best spots in NYC too. I never thought I would find a place in the states, outside of NYC, that I would put in my top 10. This place just cracked my list.

It was so good. The crust, sauce, and mozzarella were all perfect. For pizza lovers, this is a must stop while in Vegas."
