Pizzas can be ordered by the slice or by the whole. We grabbed two slices of the supreme pizzas. The supreme pizza was delicious, packed with flavor and had a nice crunchy crust to it. 

Note: pizza slices run about $6 each 

They have a few arcade games to keep one busy as well but I was too occupied with my pizza to even care! Place is small and seating is limited but there are places outside in the foyer up sit and eat!"
