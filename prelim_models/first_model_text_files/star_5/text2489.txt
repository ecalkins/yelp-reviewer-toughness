I was so amped when I found it, thanks to you previous 21 yelpers. I LOVE pizza, and I think I might have found my favorite pizza place besides Grimaldi's. Then again, I came at 3 in the morning, was given a free slice of pizza AND a free slice of cheesecake, AND great conversation so I could be a little influenced but I'm pretty sure it's excellent.

Please try the white pizza with tomatoes. Your tastebuds will thank you.
Please make sure you have some gum with you. Your friends and other strangers will thank you.

Nico and Cristos are food artists. 'Artists' would have been italicized if that were allowed.

The slice of cheesecake is pretty clutch, too.

Bring tip money! You'll need it, i swear!"
