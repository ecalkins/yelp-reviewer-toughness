I think I was craving pizza after using up all my energy at XS. My friends managed to find this AWESOME hidden gem at the cosmo. There are no signs for this pizza place but I was so drunk. I don't remember how we got there but I remember when I went inside I knew exactly what I wanted to order. MUSHROOM PIZZA! I think my bf told me I wanted to order a whole pizza. But I was so hungry..... I guess I forgot to add the word slice after pizza. So we ended up ordering two slices. for $10. Pricey! But GOOOOOD in my tummy...... 

It was soo good.. I came back for more on my last night in vegas... before going to Serendipity and clubbing for the night. I will definitely come back here each time I'm in Vegas now.. Best NY style pizzaaaa I've had. Well, maybe I'm hyping it up a little too much. But it was pretty bomb! :) I think I also kept calling it Pizzeria 'cause I didn't know the name of it and I was drunk. Oops hehe. Secret pizza, I love you. ^_^"
