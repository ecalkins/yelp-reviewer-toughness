It's not had to find, take the escalator to the 3rd floor food area once on the 3rd floor you will see a small hallway with LP Albums on it follow it to some of the best pizza on the strip. The pizza is sold by the slice($5.00) and. Cup of soda $4.00 (free refills while eating there). The pizza tastes just like it should. It's not soggy and stands up to the last bite. I would recommend Secret Pizza to anyone who wants to taste some of the best pizza around.
