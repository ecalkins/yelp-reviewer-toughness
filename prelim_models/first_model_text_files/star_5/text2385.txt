They have a good selection of pizza, veggies, meats you name it. It's sooo good here. I think it's the best I've had since new york! I had the sundried tomatoes, pepperoncini, and green bell peppers. Their slices are huge, but with my HUGE appetite I had two slices and I was STUFFED! You need to visit this place! That is... if you can find it ;)
