When you're wandering through the Cosmo, feeling broke as a joke after a night of gambling and/or partying, what a sight for sore eyes this place will be... once you find it, of course! Once you make your way through the narrow corridor lined with record covers, you'll approach what may be the most deliciously crispy pizza crust in all of Las Vegas!

The prices are dirt cheap, the people are friendly, and they're open til 4am. How can I keep something so wondrous a secret???"
