Fresh thin crust Pizza at your fingertips! We stopped by here for a snack and decided that this is the perfect after clubbing snack as well. Marked it down that we will stop by here after clubbing.  I opted for the White Pizza Ricotta + mozzarella cheese pizza. Delish! The crust was perfect ! 

Really enjoyed it and sure enough the next night after Marquee we stopped by here for another slice! Tried the sausage one this time - not as much as a fan as the Ricotta Cheese one. They come out really greasy so if you watching your calories, dab it with some napkins. 

Line gets loooong after the clubs, you will need to be patient next to the drunkards in line."
