Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, no sign, but you'll know you're getting close because you'll see a line of hungry people and you'll smell something secretly delicious. It's a tiny kitchen with some bro's for cooks. The super crowded environment adds to the feel, like you just stumbled upon the bounce house of pizza. It's by the slice, two is plenty. Get the White Pizza, just do it.
