The first time I came here with friends when the hotel first opened. We were wandering and ended up walking down a hall with no name, and ended up in a tiny area filled with people all waiting to taste the delicious pizza!  It can be a little greasy at times, but one night won't hurt after dancing for many hours prior. I can't tell how many times I've been here. A friend and I drove to the Cosmo just to get pizza. I just love the Cosmopolitan overall!
