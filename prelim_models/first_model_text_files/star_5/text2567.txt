Called to ask if they had  white pizza and how long it would be to order a whole pie .. Joe answered was super nice and helpful .. told me to head there in twenty min or 35 for a whole pizza .. was worried about time since there was some traffic so opted for four slices.. got there in ten .. I luckily the pizza hadn't come out of the oven yet b.c there was quite a line .. paid for four slices $20 .. waited ten min .. inhaled a slice and they packaged three for me to go ... with transportation these four slices costed me $15 a piece .. but I still love this pizza and so worth it .. and I don't even like pizza 

Tried to find white pizza in Seattle .. pfft .. Costco pizza is their best pizza -.-"
