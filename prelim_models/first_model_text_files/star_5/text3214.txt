The individual pizza slices are proportionally generously.  The pizza dough is ultra thin, and the combination of cheesy goodness and tangy tomato sauce makes this pizza mouthwateringly great!  

I usually get the pepperoni.  It's a oldie but a classic!  If you can find this hidden treasure you'll discover this gem is well worth the tolls of the search!!!"
