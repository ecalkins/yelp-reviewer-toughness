Although the place is not much of a secret anymore since everyone and their mamas could be found standing in the hour + line at 2am after clubbing at Marquee. It seems like the typical thing to do now if you ever find yourself during that time at the Cosmo. 

I had the pleasure of staying at the Cosmo for two nights and during the first night I came with my bf at 10pm with no lines and we only waited for about 15 minutes for our customized white pizzas that came fresh from the oven. But during the second night I came with Sidney T. after clubbing and the line was ridiculous! It stretched out into the lobby area! Also, since it took us an hour to even get to the front, we just opted for the pre-made pizza that's been sitting out and I have to say it was just not the same as ordering it and eating it fresh from the oven. I'd definitely recommend ordering it fresh and don't forget to add the oregano and chili flakes from the condiment counter for extra yumminess!"
