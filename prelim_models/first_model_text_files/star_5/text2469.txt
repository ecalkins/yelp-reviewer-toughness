There is a long hallway full of old school ads/artwork toward Secret Pizza. The reason being it secret because it isn't on the directory. But it isn't a secret anymore with over three thousand reviews!! 

They have the white sauce, red sauce and Sicilian pizza (which they ran out). I had a first bad impression about their pizza as soon as I saw the pizza laying on the counter that looks old and pale... but I was wrong, they heat them up for you in the hot oven before serving. Did I mention that this was the CHEAPEST MEAL in VEGAS?! 2 slices for about $6. CRISPY, gooey cheese, THIN CRUST, and simply delicious... I can imagine myself here at 4AM (they open until really late) after a drunk night. 

Probably one of my highlight meals in Vegas. A SUPER MUST TRY!"
