I've been going here since they first opened, it is way too crowded now. Atmosphere is still great being a hidden hallways. But there should be more things to do in the area rather then opening up new restaurants around it. 

The white pizza is a must and is the staple of this place. 

Price is around 5.50 per slice 
Whole pizza was maybe 28 to 32 I think. 


Great pizza though"
