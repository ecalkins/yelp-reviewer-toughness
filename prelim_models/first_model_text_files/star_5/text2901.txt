You could hear the music from the common area so it really is not ""that"" secret but amazing pizza. You walk down this long all lined with old record covers and you can see a old pinball machine at the end. A person at the hotel said I had to have the White Pizza which I did and it was good. It was NY Style and is HUGE. The crust was kinda like garlic bread. They dont offer a bunch of types of pizza and also offer beer/wine and soda. The slices are $5 and well worth it. If I am back in town I will make a point to head back here."
