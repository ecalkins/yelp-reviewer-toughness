I typically always stay at the Cosmopolitan when I'm in Vegas so it's an easy trek for me, but even if you're not, if you're in the Cosmo and you're looking for an affordable place to grab a bite, come check it out.

It's cheap, open after your Marquee nightclub adventures, and has lots of options for your liking. Yes, it's a bit difficult to find, and the line will most likely be out the door once you get there, but it is worth the wait, especially with how expensive everywhere else is! 

But in actuality, it is good pizza and I'd say give it a go. I've had it sober and drunk, and I'll recommend regardless."
