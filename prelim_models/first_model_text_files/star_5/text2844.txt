I will admit, the allure of a hidden non-advertised pizza place already had me excited...but after a long Vegas evening, this place was truly magical. Try anything they have available or order something specific and you will Not be disappointed! Their white pie is garlic heaven, their red saucers par for any pizza course and all of their toppings were quite tasty. For people who like spicy food (New Mexicans like myself), I recommend their house made pepperoncini peppers! What a great place to stumble upon at 2 am.
