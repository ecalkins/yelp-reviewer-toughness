Now, I tried to resist. I really did. My friends got the pizza one afternoon and I was like, ""None for me."" FOOL. I know. FOOL. However, finally, after the Drake concert (and alcohol), I caved. I caved and got the best slice imaginable. I pointed and said, ""That one."" ""That one"" consisted of cheese, ricotta cheese, and meatballs... Um, hi. I also ordered a water, because health. The crust was perfectly light and crispy and the pizza was just TOO GOOD (I probably said that about 10 times between each bite).

The secret is out as to location in the Cosmopolitan hotel, or you KNOW I would not be sharing that location. All the more for me.

Secret Pizza, can you Post-Mate to SF? Greatly appreciated."
