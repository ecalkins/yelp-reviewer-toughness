Grab a slice and go sit by STK and people watch...if you can remember what happened it's usually some pretty good people watching at that time of the early morning.

Can we all agree that this place is great b/c you don't even want to know how much I would be spending on room service if this ""secret"" pizza place did not exist.

I love you ""secret"" pizza place."
