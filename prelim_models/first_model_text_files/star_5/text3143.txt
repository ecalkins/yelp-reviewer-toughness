A little spice in it. We asked the concierge where this place was located and they would say because it's a secret! Loved going on a hunt for this place. Overall I totally understand why this place has amazing ratings! Tip- there isn't really much space to sit down so we lounged right outside the restaurant! Thank you Yelpers for this awesome find!"
