On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.

It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.

The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.

I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.

They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.

When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the true genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.

My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.

Dig in and don't let go!

Secret Pizza you get the FlavorBoner trophy on this trip.

I'll be wrapping my teeth around you soon, just not during nightclub hours as I have heard the line is way too insane.

BTW....

When at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, if it is a weekend or holiday, go to the Chandelier Lounge on the main floor. They have a band called MARK and The Martinis and they are excellent. The lead singer embodies all that is classic Las Vegas; he sings, he jokes, he interacts with the patrons. He does Sinatra, Dean and Sammy proud."
