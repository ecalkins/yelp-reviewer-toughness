I'm not kidding; these guys could throw down with any pizza joint in NYC, so dropping them in Las Vegas is like winning a gold in the Special Olympics & not being handicapped - there's no contest. 
(Why is this in The Cosmopolitan & not New York, New York? Seems like a missed branding opportunity but I digress.) 

This place is the best pizza in Las Vegas, period. 
It's a tiny hole, with an old school Galaga game, a wall mounted tv, and just a few stools & counters, so you're standing up or you're taking it to go. 

Buy it by the slice (around $8 each) or plan on waiting if you need a whole pie ordered because they make it from scratch when you do. 
(Yes, if you're wondering, it is absolutely worth the wait.) 
Sicilian style or traditional thin crust, they usually have four pies out on display at a time but they turn over new pies in minutes (they're steady busy so slices sell quickly) - there's always fresh pie in the oven about to come out if you don't like your initial available choices. 

A ""must stop"" for me every time I'm in Vegas. Relatively inexpensive (not cheap; they have to run a profitable business 18 hours a day, 7 days a week so it's about $8 a slice) but certainly reasonable compared to most of the purchases you make on The Strip ($5.99 for a bottle of water, anyone?)"
