Don't worry about the toppings, it's not about the toppings here. It's about the crust and the sauce, both of which this little pizzeria knocks out of the park.

The sauce on this pizza is perfectly seasoned, and there's just the right amount. But the best part is the hand-tossed crust. People usually like thin crust because it's crispy. People usually like pan crust because it's doughy. THIS crust manages to be crispy AND doughy. We figured that one large (10 slices) was enough to feed 5 of us (3 girls, 2 guys), but this pizza was so good that we had to order another large to go.

The prices here are a bit steep ($4 for a 2-topping slice, $22 for a 3-topping large), but the premium price will definitely get you some premium pie."
