The pizza is pretty darn good- since I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob. It was reminiscent of NY pizza, which I love!  Also, loved the fact that they sell by the slice and pie- they also have a couple of beers on tap so you can grab a pitcher and a pie a kick it just outside in the seating area, which is what we did.
