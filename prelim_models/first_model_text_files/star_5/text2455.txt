The pinball and arcade games give it a vintage feel. The pizzas are similar to NY style pizza with large slices. Can't go wrong with the mushroom and cheese pizza. The pepperoni and sausage pizza was also delicious. FYI - The slices are about $7.50 each. Overall, a great place to sober up and enjoy late night food.
