Because nothing in Vegas is really a secret and everyone in Vegas is friendly, just ask someone if you can't find it and they will draw you a map, talk you through it carefully, ask you about what else you're doing on your trip, and then walk you personally to the hallway. They have some pinball and a small counter to order along with some additional counter space hugging the walls to eat. 

All of the pizza options are delicious. There are also some alcohol options, which taste as expected, but the pizza--the pizza is delicious. My favorite was the white pizza, which I didn't originally order but I overheard a private tour guide talking to a small family about how the specialty is the white pizza, so obviously I had to grab a slice. Dressed in garlic and oil, it was definitely the winner of an already victorious meal."
