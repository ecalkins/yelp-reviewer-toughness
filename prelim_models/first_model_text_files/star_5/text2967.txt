-I came here for a slice of pizza after I had eaten dinner at Earl's of Sandwiches and I was supposedly ""full.""
-I have made it a point to stay at the Cosmopolitan on my future Vegas trips because Secret Pizza only delivers if you're a guest at the Cosmopolitan. 

Hard to find especially when the Cosmopolitan's own workers don't even know what Secret Pizza is. It's that secret, but I'll help you out because pizza this good should be enjoyed by the masses. Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. Find the lounge area with a pool table. Just off that lounge area is a dark, unmarked hallway lined with records on the hall. Follow this hallway to pizza heaven."
