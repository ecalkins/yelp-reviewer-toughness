Cheap, Fast, Greasy, ad Delicious. What more can you ask for? I heard this place gets pretty packed around 3-4am when everyone is being kicked out of the club. I went at 2AM (I specifically left Marquee early, on a mission to eat this pizza) and there was no line.  There isn't must variety to choose from (3-4 kinds of pizza) but who care when you have the after-the-club-munchies? Not me! Pizza is Pizza - but this pizza is to die for! Must try!"
