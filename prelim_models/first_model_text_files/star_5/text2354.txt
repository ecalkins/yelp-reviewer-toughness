We had this as lunch when we rolled into town. There was a small line but it moved rather fast. Only 4 options: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom and another specialty. I got cheese and my friend got mushroom. The server warmed up our slices in the oven for us.

I took my first bite and was blown away! Traditional NYC pizza. Simply marvelous.

Yes pricey for a slice but priceless in terms of authenticity. Go now!"
