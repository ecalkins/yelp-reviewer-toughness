Thanks to a fellow Yelper who posted a photo of the hallway lined with record covers. We passed it then saw a glimpse of the hallway. A must stop each and every time we are in Vegas. We have tried many different flavors including pepperoni, cheese, combo, pepperoni mushroom. They are all amazing. Combo is my favorite but i will take whatever they have ready. It feels like being in a secret society of pizza. We smile at fellow pizza eaters and watch as newbies struggle to find it. We have had people stop us and ask ""Where did you get the pizza"" and just point at the hallway. LOL"
