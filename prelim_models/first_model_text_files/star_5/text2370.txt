I found this place from a secret blog I found a couple months before our trip to Vegas, and we were bound and determined to find it. It's a long hallway with a couple guys at the end in this little room behind what looks similar to a deli counter, flipping pizzas back and forth the whole time. The ""white"" pizza is by far, THE BEST. Made from an assortment of cheese, ricotta, fresh herbs and well, I'm not really sure of what else, but it doesn't matter because it's AMAZING. It's the definition of a laid-back, pick-up-your-pizza-and-go, type of place. But it has a casual, authentic old-style-italian atmosphere. It looked like a couple of grandson's working for their old-school italian grandpa behind the counter and you can tell by the atmosphere in there, that they love it.

HIGHLY recommend finding this place, and keeping it on the down-low, so that it can remain a low-key (secret), special place, for the people that know about it!"
