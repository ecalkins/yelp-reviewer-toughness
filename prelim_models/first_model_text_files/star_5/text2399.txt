Kristin C. raved about the pizza while we were eating lunch at the Cosmopolitan and my boyfriend and I were a bit skeptical that pizza could be THAT good.  Well, we ate our words later that night.

After catching a show at a neighboring casino, my boyfriend and I cabbed it to the Cosmopolitan to meet up with everyone who was at Marquee enjoying Kaskade.  Unfortunately, we never met up - but fortunately, I had a really good slice of pizza! The crust is chewy and the tomato sauce is flavorful. AND, the pizza is relatively cheap for Vegas/Cosmopolitan prices (around $3/slice of cheese).  While we were standing in line for pizza, a FIGHT broke out! That's how crazy good the pizza is.  Take my word for it.

The best part of enjoying the pizza? It's too small and cramped to eat inside the actual Pizzeria, so venture outside and people watch.  Not only was Kaskade djing at Marquee that night, but the Strokes had played a show at the Cosmopolitan.  My boyfriend and I played a fun game of ""Marquee line reject or Strokes fan?""  Surprisingly not as easy as you think! Platinum blonde, short mini dress, stripper heels and CHEST TATTOO. Marquee line reject or Strokes fan??? YOU TELL ME!"
