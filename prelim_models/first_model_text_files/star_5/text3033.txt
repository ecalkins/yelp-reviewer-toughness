It's a pizza place in Vegas so my expectations ran high. To my surprise, the pizza was actually pretty amazing. From the sauce, to the cheese, to the crust....mmmm too much flavor for one slice. I also like how large the slices are because one can stir up quite an appetite while drinking the night away.
