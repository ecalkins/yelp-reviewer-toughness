though, there's no giant sign to direct you there. There's an alley way inside the cosmopolitan that leads you to the little pizza store. Luckily the line wasn't too ridiculous. They have a variety of pizza to choose from and you can make your own too. My friends and I each got two slices, one white each thanks to my friend's recommendation and one pepperoni, one sausage and peperoncino, and another sausage one.

The slices were huge, like Costco pizza slices, definitely filling enough, 2 each killed us. 1.5 each would of satisfied us just fine. The white pizza was great. It was a variety of cheeses I believe and normally I hate crumbly cheese like feta but whatever was on that pizza was delicious. It was a bit oily but what good pizza isn't. We came here for lunch but it's opened super late which is great for late night Vegas munchies! I used to always go to earls but now I know the Vegas secret ! I'll be back for more secret pizza! 

Note: there isn't much sitting space since it's a small store. Usually it's a grab and go, we took our pizza and ate on the couches outside!"
