Let me just say, I was extremely drunk, and this place was a bit of a mission to find, but once we did, we were loving it! It's located at the cosmopolitan, on the third floor of ""The Chandelier."" It's pretty hard to miss if you're not actually looking for it. Let me just say, I appreciate a good pizza, and this my friends, was something close to perfect!!! With its crunchy crust and delicious toppings, this place is the place to be when you're hungry and drunk! I wish they had a location in LA, absolutely loved it!"
