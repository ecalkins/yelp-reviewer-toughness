The cosmopolitan was pretty busy considering it was a Sunday night but we managed to find this spot pretty easily (ok we had to ask one of the workers but we were close)! 

Exit the 3rd floor elevator and make a right and right into a narrow hallway and bam! A little hole in the wall pizza spot with some delicious options! Slices are about $5-$6 and pretty big! Their red sauce is seriously flavorful.

I couldn't decide so I got both the white slice and veggie slice. Typically I would choose white over anything but I actually preferred their veggie- good sauce to topping radio. Also, it wasn't soggy and wet which usually happens with veggie pizzas 

slices were up before we could even finish paying. Came out on a paper plate, nothing fancy. Beer was in a red plastic cup! No more than 4 chairs in the place but you're in vegas so you can eat and drink wherever!"
