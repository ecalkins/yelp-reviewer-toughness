Try their white pizza which is supposedly their speciality, we tried it and it was delicious. Their cheese pizza was good too.

Only thing is we were told that all their meat options were pork based. This didn't work for my muslim friend who accompanied me, and I'm sure it wouldn't work for my jewish friend either. luckily their specialty is vegetarian so thumbs up all round"
