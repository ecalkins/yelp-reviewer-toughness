I remember one weekend in Vegas I literally had Secret Pizza for 3 days straight.  I was thinking...why do I want anything else??!?  Granted that weekend I was staying in one of the Bungalows at the Cosmo, so that helped.  Even when I am not staying at the Cosmo, I find myself there at least once during my trip for a slice...or 10.  

You won't find any signs for this place but just follow the wonderful pizza smell down a long hall way on the third floor of the Cosmo near the exit of Marquee as well as restaurants, Milo and STK.  If you see a long line down a hallway, they aren't waiting for the restroom or trying to get into the backdoor of Marquee...it's Secret Pizza doing their magic..."
