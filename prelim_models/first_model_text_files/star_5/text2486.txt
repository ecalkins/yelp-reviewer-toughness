- Open until 5 AM.
- They sell PBR dispensed in red cups
- The irony of having a restaurant that sells $5 slices of NY style pizza next door to places like Jose Andres' Jaleo and Estiatorio Milos.
- Limited amount of seating.

Everything about this place screams hipster, and normally I would avoid places like this like the plague, but turns out that it's pretty damn good. Someone bought a whole pizza for the room, and after we come back from the clubs at like 6 in the morning, I find a half-eaten, cold slice of pepperoni and sausage buried under some paper...still amazing. This pizza passes with flying colors on the time test.

Later...instead of eating at Jaleo, I get a strong hankering for pizza. Hot and fresh out of the oven...effing delicious."
