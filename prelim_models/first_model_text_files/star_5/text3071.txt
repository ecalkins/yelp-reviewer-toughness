Technically, it's not labeled on the directory and there's no sign but judging by the line that stretched almost to the outside of the hallway of records, the secret cat has been let out of the secret bag. That's okay though because it's still worth visiting if you find yourself drunk, hungry, or both in the Cosmo. I'm not going to lie and tell you that the line moves fast but it crawls along just quick enough to keep you hopeful that you'll get something to eat before your morning flight takes off. The price point is in the $5-6 range per slice which seems pretty standard for pizza by the slice on the strip but I gotta be honest, this is literally the best slice of pizza I've had in recent memory! The crust is really what makes Secret pizza excel over other comparable places. Full disclosure, the slices here are slightly smaller than Pin Up Pizza or Pizza Forte at the Hard Rock but the excellent quality more than makes up for the slightly lesser value. Being a Las Vegas local, I definitely don't find myself on the strip all that often but next time I'm at the Cosmo, I'm definitely gonna to get me a slice at Secret Pizza!
