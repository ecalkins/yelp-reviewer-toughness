When I first walked in, I wasn't blown away by their choices. But, the simpler the better right? Well for this place it definitely is.

I got a piece of the white sauce pizza. I'm usually kind of grossed out by oily pizza, but this one was awesome. I was trying to eat slow to savor the pizza, but it was so good you just want to inhale it. Quite the predicament, huh?"
