Solution: Secret Pizza

This place is a hole in the wall located inside a fancy shopping mall.  It gave off a very classic pizza shop vibe and even has classic arcade games located inside.  I ordered a large slice of pepperoni pizza.  The pizza felt very homey with its size and large pizza crust.  It was very flavorful and really satisfied my craving.  I'm glad out of all the fancy places here in Vegas, you can still count on finding an awesome, classy pizza joint.  

P.S. you just feel cool walking into Secret Pizza.  Cause it's secret and all."
