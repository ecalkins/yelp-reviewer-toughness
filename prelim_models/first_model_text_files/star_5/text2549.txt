When you come to Cosmo you are thinking overpriced restaurants. This place is like a fast food restaurant in a luxury hotel. The price is reasonable. You can come here and grab something to eat and go party. Pizza topping is excellent. I can taste the fresh ingredients. Say goodbye to frozen pizza at home.
