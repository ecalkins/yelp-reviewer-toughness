0	"80s arcade nostalgia and some bomb pizza.

This secret pizza joint is hidden on the 3rd floor near the pool table down a long hall.  Very cool decor with pinball machines and just has a 80s kid hangout vibe to it.  They are open late and the pizza is damn good.

White pizza - thin crust with little mounds of ricotto cheese dispersed all over.  Add whatever toppings your feeling.  I went with mushroom, olives, and peppercinis and it was real good.

Beer - PBR or Stone IPA served in the red party cups, sweet!

I also saw some people getting single slices and adding a ton of toppings like sausage and meatball slices, looked like a meat lovers paradise.

Cool spot , good price, open late."
