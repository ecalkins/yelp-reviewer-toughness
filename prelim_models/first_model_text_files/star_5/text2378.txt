Ever since discovering the magical corridor, I make Secret Pizza a Vegas trip must! 

I don't know what the addicting part of this place is, but I love it! Is it the pizza? Is it the 'secret'? It's probably both.. heh

Anywho, me and my friends usually split the same thing every single time: A white pie with sausage. Why change something you know and love? We've also tried other pizzas but this one has remained true and steady to our hearts.

A pie can cost you around $25-30 depending on what you get and if you add anything. Your choice, your money. Of course, they also sell by the slice premade but we also order a fresh one and just wait, sometimes 20-30 minutes for our pie.

There's a water cooler for drinks as well as beverages for purchase. The interior is a vintage arcade meets pizza parlor and there are several pinball and video game machines for those waiting. 

Seating can be a bit meh, but we always just eat outside near the pool tables or on the long tables along the side by the restrooms. 

FYI, for those that do not know the secret yet.. 3rd floor Cosmo!"
