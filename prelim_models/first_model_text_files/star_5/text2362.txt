It was a pain to find, but after Googling for a few minutes I was able to locate it.

Even after stuffing my face at Planet Hollywood's buffet, I had to grab a slice of the white pizza here. Luckily the white pie was the freshest one on the counter. It took no time at all to order and I only had to wait a few minutes for my slice to heat up in the oven.

As an east coaster I've eaten tons of NY pizza and its imitations... And this slice was up there with the best. If only the bottom of the crust were slightly more blackened and cracker-like would it be the real deal.

That being said this was awesome and hands down the beat slice I had in Vegas."
