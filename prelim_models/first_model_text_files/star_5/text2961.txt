The concierge told my uncle about this place upon checking into the hotel, and I am so happy she did!! This is our second time here this weekend, and after trying several different slices, this was definitely the big winner. The White Pizza speaks true to its name, having only white sauce, cheese and a ricotta herb cheese dolloped on top. The herb ricotta adds the perfect flavor to this pizza and i would get it again and again! Best part is it's open almost 24 hours so it's perfect for drunchies after hitting Marquee at night! The next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be coming back to this place.
