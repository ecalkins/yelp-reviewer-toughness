I had been here once before (many years ago) but I think back then I was too wasted to remember where it was. Actually, it's pretty easy to find, though describing the exact location in my Yelp review seems to defy the whole point of visiting Secret Pizza, so I won't divulge.

The staff who works here are super nice for people who have to deal with drunk hungry people all the time. Well, that's my assumption, but we were here on a Monday night so perhaps the crowd was more time. I ordered two slides, one of the white pizza and the other with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was too much for me to eat, but I knew one slide would be too little. I was satisfied by the hot and fresh pizza nevertheless! So glad that my friend and I decided to come here. Such a simple meal and a must-try in Vegas."
