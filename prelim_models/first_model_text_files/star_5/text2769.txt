Sure, it's a teeny bit pricey for a slice, and if you go at the wrong time, the line is ridiculous. Plus, there are very few places to sit; the place is a hole in the wall. But the pizza is so good that we once bought a whole pie and smuggled it on to the plane so we could eat it at home. And it was still great the next day."
