It is super hard to find and not even listed on any of the maps or anything, if you go to the third floor your best bet is to look for hallway-looking walkway covered in records, look twice before turning around and you will find it.  The price is amazing, especially for overpriced Vegas.  And for less than $5 a slice, probably one of the best tasting budget-friendly meals you can have in the strip.  The white pizza was my absolute fav, in fact I am craving some now.  You will not be disappointed, eat here early on your trip and you'll likely return for more before leaving and save lots of money in the process.  Oh, and great service too- super friendly and quick!
