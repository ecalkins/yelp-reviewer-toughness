I Go To The Strip All The Time and eat at many places.  

This Place Is Like Going Down A Hall Way to Get To It, Imagine you Are following The Yellow Brick Road To Emerald City :)

I'm Italian and This Pizza Is Awesome!  You can taste all ingredients on your pizza and every bite is just as good as the last!

Little pricey, but worth it!

A Must Go!

I Totally recommend for all!"
