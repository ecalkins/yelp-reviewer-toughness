We had 8 people and it filled us up perfectly. One pie was the white pizza while the other is the supreme pizza with everything on it. I wasn't too crazy about the supreme, which would taste even better from any pizza chain. But the white pizza is covered with ricotta cheese and other white cheesy heavenly ingredients. The slices are huge cuts and two slices stuffed me. 

Be aware that there's only a small counter here with two seats, but you can find some couches and a pool table outside to sit and eat."
