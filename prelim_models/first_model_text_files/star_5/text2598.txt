T.H.E. place to drag your post Marquee, hung over, puked out, makeup-less ass to stuff face....if you don't mind the walk of shame, that is.  Of course there are plenty of normal ppl (Meee) lining up for the delicious NY style pizza by the slice or box. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=4NbyT2TlL2PdMyrG-0BLLA

$5 per slice or $22 per box, this baby is like the 2am diiiirty hot dog on Hollywood Blvd but better. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hollywood-blvd-hotdog-vendor-hollywood#hrid:HID2ZLJ9bBGibM5yP-NX3g Don't mind the wait, chat up the stranger standing in front of you or behind you and dont' judge if someone suddenly made a mad dash out to the restroom (comes standard when you are waiting with a bunch of equally boozed out crowd).

I'm actually craving for a slice right now...mmmm....pizzzaaaaa"
