So, $30 for a pizza sounds high, right?  But when that pizza is bigger than the wheel of a monster truck and you're on the notoriously expensive and overpriced Las Vegas Strip, this is a screaming deal.  One pizza kept two of us fed (off and on) for easily three days and probably saved us from at least two or three $50+ meals.  

The key to making it worthwhile is to time the line so there isn't much of a wait.  We skipped this place a few times when the lunch lines were massive, and although we tried once to call ahead and place an order, they never picked up the phone.  But on a weekday at 2pm - no problemo!  We ordered, took a quick wander, came back 20 minutes later and they practically greeted us at the door with our pizza and a big smile.  This place beats the pants off the late night pizza joint in NYNY, and if you've got a fridge or a big group, a full pizza pie is a great option.  For smaller groups, the individual slices are well worth checking out."
