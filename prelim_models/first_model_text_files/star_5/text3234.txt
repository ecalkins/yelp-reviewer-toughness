This pizza is great! Light crust, slightly spicy sausage, yummy pepperoni and just enough grease. 

Yes, the line is long but does move quickly. For the price, it is almost worth buying a whole box and saving some for the next day. You can call in your order, which helps you skip the line! 

A definite must for anyone who has had *too* much fun at Marquee."
