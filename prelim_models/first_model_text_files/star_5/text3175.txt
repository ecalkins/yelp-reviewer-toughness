The reviews are correct, it's billiard adjacent and around the corner from the club. There are a couple counter spots, but if those are taken, you may just be using the pinball machine as a table. The Sicilian was spicy and delicious and hit the spot. There are many slices to choose from and the people are friendly and helpful. Thank you secret pizza!
