I heard great things about secret pizza and it did not disappoint, in fact it is close to taking over Gino's spot for favorite pizza. Great consistency with the crust, the toppings and cheese are amazing. I took one bite and thought I was in heaven. I would highly recommend anyone to find this location in the Cosmopolitan hotel when coming to Vegas. 2 slices filled me up and that's hard to do when it comes to pizza.
