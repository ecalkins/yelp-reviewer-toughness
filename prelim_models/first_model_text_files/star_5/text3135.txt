I have read that lines can be very long here however we must have gotten lucky when we came because there was only about four people in the entire restaurant. They have very interesting decor inside and on the walls. 

When you approach the counter you can see their menu board. However they can also custom make certain pizzas for you. The pizza slices are all moderately priced and the selection is very big. When you choose what kind you want they warm it up in the oven for you. Now I dont know if this oven is magical or the ingredients are super fresh, but the pizza was one of the most delicious tasting slices I have EVER eaten. 

I highly recommend checking this place out and I will be sure to always stop by during my Vegas adventures."
