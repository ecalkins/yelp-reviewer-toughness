We were in Vegas this time for 4 days, three of those days we had pizza from the Secret Pizza restaurant. We learned of the location by word of mouth. We found the place tucked away in a far away corner on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The pizza was a bit on the pricier side but in retrospect well worth it. If you are a pizza lover, I highly recommend this place.
