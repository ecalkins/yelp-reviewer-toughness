The long line is so worth the wait even in your 6-inch post clubbing shoes (dont take your shoes off....thats not cute ladies). I waited for appprrooooxxxx 25 mins but it goes by quick when chatting with the other people in line. You will be soooo glad you made that wait. Seriously considering just going to vegas for this meal alone. If LA had a spot like this (does it? yelp a sista out!!) i would go allll theeeee time! mm mmm
