The thin crust has that nice crack to it when you fold it and is crispy enough to hold the end up in a triangle so you can eat on the go. The wait wasn't bad when we went, under 20 minutes from the middle of the unmarked hallway on a Saturday night. That makes me think that unless a ton of folks are ordering whole pies, even a line out the door is under an hour.

I applaud them for not offering ranch - that's some weird midwest or west coast topping that folks put on pizza to mask how awful it is. Unnecessary for NY Pizza!

$5 a slice seems pretty shocking at first, but it is in a hot casino in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, so I won't hold it against them. $4 for a Coke in a Solo cup is lame, so we bought the 2L bottle for $6.50. What a markup!"
