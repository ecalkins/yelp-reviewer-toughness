The Secret pizza in the Cosmopolitan is definitely by far one of the coolest ideas that the strip ever came up with after a night at chandelier or the dry bar or hanging out at marquee whether it be the poor or gambling upstairs it doesn't matter everybody loves the secret pizza it's just like you are in Manhattan for a second there is a quick line but you have to find a place first if you ask the security guard or someone that works in the hotel they will tell you whether it's located yes it's a secret only because there is no advertise meant there is literally a door and inside it is a replica of the New York City pizza parlour that is open late and it sells pizza by the slice
The pizza is absolutely incredible but it's something that you do when you are at the Cosmopolitan. 
I definitely recommend also the people that work there are always very very nice but just prepared to stand in a line but the line goes quickly and it is worth it there are nice comfortable seats to sit outside in the hotel to eat your pizza and watch people walk by"
