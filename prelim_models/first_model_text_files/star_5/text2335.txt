The Pizza: Delicious Giant Slices of Wonderment. However, don't be fooled into thinking you don't have options. They have pizza available that's already out and on display, but things are coming out of the oven all the time and they will add extra toppings to their slices for you. Also everything tastes better with Dogfish Head IPAs. (Which is a beer if you're curious).

Not hard to find if you're looking for it, but you're not going to know it's an establishment if you don't. Tiny little place, no room for seating unless you count the top of the pristine Galaga Machine or go when one of the five seats aren't taken. This place is probably to be avoided if you hate lines or crowds and you go during peak.

I got out of there for $15 bucks: Two Giant Slices and a Dogfish Head. This is a great deal on the strip. Also as a bonus: the girl at the cash register was crazy hot. According to my friends, I of course am not in the habit of oogling random females; they are the childish barbarians.

TL;DR:
Cons: No Seating. Pizza arrangement vague. Only two kinds of beer.

Pros: Lots of seating outside. Pizza is spectacular. Beer on tap includes the best of the worst (PBR) and Dogfish Head 60min (the best of the best)."
