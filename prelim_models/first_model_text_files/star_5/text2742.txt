And secret pizza combines all of these items traditionally and beautifully. New York style Pizza should mix fresh ingredients, a nice crunchy and doughy crust with tasty cheese, and this spot is definitely the best New York style I've had west of the Mississippi. If I close my eyes, I'm transported to a more innocent time, of accents, train rides and being back home. This pizza is worth the trip to vegas even if it's super expensive for a slice.

Oh by the way, it's located on the third floor of the cosmo near the shops and restaurants side, not the convention side. If you see a Japanese restaurant there should be a half right next to it with records lining the walls!"
