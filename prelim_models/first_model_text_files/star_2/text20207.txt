Our main complaint is the customer service (or lack of). The friendly, helpful staff has disappeared. Where did they go? Who brought in the second stringers from AJ's? Grumpy is not attractive. Though I must give the Sushi folks credit for enthusiasm and free samples.  

The layout of the bakery and deli departments is so crowded we avoid that area completely. The aisles seem more narrow than before. 

We now hit up Albertson's, Bashas and Costco.I am sad to lose my good old Fry's!!  We'll pop in once and awhile to see if by chance things change."
