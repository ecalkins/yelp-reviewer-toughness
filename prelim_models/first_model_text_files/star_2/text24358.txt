It was extremely dry and the cheese was over cooked.   No tomato sauce.  Similar to dry toast with burnt cheese.    The second pizza was a deep dish pizza.   It was like a large ball of cheese.   Usually we enjoy their pizza, but not last night.   The Pablo Picasso salad was very good.    Usually we enjoy their food.   They need to work on providing good food more consistently.
