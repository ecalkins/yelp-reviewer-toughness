I was somewhat impressed with this place until I went into the laser tag. 4 kids running the laser tag area and goofing around before we even started playing. Then all 4 goofballs ended up playing laser tag which seemed pretty unfair to the little kids. Would probably go back if it had a more employee friendly atmosphere!
