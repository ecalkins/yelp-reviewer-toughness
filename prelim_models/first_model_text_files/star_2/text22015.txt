First off upon approaching the restaurant the door man was so busy speaking to the hostess that he completely let the door close on my face. That wasn't a big deal to me. I can open a door right? Next we were seated the restraint it self is very nice the lighting white linen table clothes. Quite romantic. After our server took our drink order she said ""so are u guys here for that Valentine's day special"".... Nothing really harmful about those words but I think it would've been more appropriate to educate patrons on the special. we received salad. Two lobster tails two steak medalions. and my husband ordered the prime rib on the side. We also received mashed potatoes and asparagus. everything was either over cooked and under seasoned. just blan. blah blan. my favorite part of the meal... was the bread basket we. revieved. now I'm not some. snobby wife who has to have everything her way but I was let down. longhorns steakhouse has prepared a better. meal then ditkas. don't waste your money. or time"
