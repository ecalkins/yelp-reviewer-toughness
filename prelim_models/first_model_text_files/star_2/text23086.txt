Sadly though the last three visits were terribly disappointing.  What happened to their juicy burgers?  What happened to seasoning the burgers?

The Stand used to remind me of the killer burgers that my dad used to make.  Flavorful, unctuous, sinful, memorable.  But now the quality is subpar.  The meat is disrespected and over cooked and under seasoned.  And now they've taken tacos off the menu?  Sad.

I feel like this location is gearing up for closure.  It's as if no one who works there cares about quality.  It's a shame that it's become what it has."
