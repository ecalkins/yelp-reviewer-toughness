Walk up to the door and was told that it would be 30-45 minutes. I was super annoyed but we waited anyway. Sat for 15 minutes before our waiter came to take our orders. Luckily he was very nice. Waited 45 minutes before our APPETIZERS came out. Ran out of drinks and could not find our waiter. Finally a manager came over and apologized for us waiting so long for an appetizer. Said she would give us free desert. By the time we finally got our food, we were ready to go home and get to bed.. We had originally planned on running errands after. Food was awful. Decided  to opt out of our free desert because we were afraid to wait another hour. This location was awful. I would never recommend it to my worst enemy.
