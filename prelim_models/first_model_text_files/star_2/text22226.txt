Service? Blah.
Ambience? Cheesy.

Its a typical sports bar, nothing to write home about. The cheeseburger (yes, I know, not their specialty) was greasy, half the fries were hard and small, and the service was slow. The manager was cool and made her way over to introduce herself, which was nice. Looking around the room youll find the typical framed jersies, including some of Scottsdale's high schools. The floor is carpeted, which I hate in restaurants. There was a waitress walking around sweeping the carpet, so they do make an effort to keep the place nice n clean. One thing BBW needs to do is cater to ALL sports fans. Of allllllll the TV's in there, only one had a hockey game on, and it was behind me. Every few minutes I would crane my neck around to check the score, as not many waitresses were around to change channels for us. All they had on was lame college football. zzzzzzzzzz"
