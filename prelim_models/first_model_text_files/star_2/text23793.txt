I placed and paid for an order on SATURDAY- for 3 1/2 dozen donuts to go on Monday morning, at 4:45 am. The girl working behind the cash register, RIMI said that would be fine if I drove through the drive-thru Monday morning to pick up my order.

Monday-today-I pull up in the drivethru, and mentioned I was there to pick up my order. The nice lady said she didn't know what I was talking about. Then a long pause. Another lady got on the microphone and said she found my ""order"" behind the computer, and was working on boxing it up now.

Not the best of service, but the donuts were fresh and that's all that matters I guess."
