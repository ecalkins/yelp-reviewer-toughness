I like the food but as others have pointed out the drive through is unbelievably slow and orders are often incorrect or incomplete. The owners have had plenty of time to sort out these kinds of issues, and they just haven't. I don't know if it's bad luck, incompetence, or a mix - but I will steer clear of The Stand in the future. I hope they can resolve the problems because the food is good. But it's not worth the trouble when there are plenty of other good options in the area.
