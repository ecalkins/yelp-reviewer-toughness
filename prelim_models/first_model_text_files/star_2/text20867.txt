The overweight guy behind the register was quick to correct me ""oh you mean the paradise bacon cheseburger"". ...he seemed offended. Sounds good I said, with a side of ranch too for the fries. He took my money as if he was doing me a favor by ringing me up. 

...once I got my food, the burger was OK, better than fast food, but not as good as I was hoping from the pictures & reviews. The fries were pretty good, but the 'ranch' was not ranch. I went to the cooler thinking the d-bag at the register mixed it up. I reached for another cup explaining what I had was some sort of potato salad. He looked offended again claiming ""oh no, that's ranch! I made it myself this morning"" ...bottom line; the paradise bacon cheseburger is better than carls jr (but SMALL), they have no idea what ranch is, their sodas are over-priced cans because they can't afford a fountain machine, & their customer service sucks. 

F this place & the land-blimp who owns it.
