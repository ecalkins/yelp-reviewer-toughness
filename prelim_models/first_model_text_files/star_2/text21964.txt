Unfortunately the chips are soggy after 1 minute. Good but soggy. I highly recommend getting chips with pico on the side. There's your bad. The good? Shrimp burro or quesadilla. Love the shrimp entrees... wish I loved the meat entrees, which leads me to the ugly: breakfast burritos.  They claim to have egg, which is true,  but it's basically like claiming to be a yummy breakfast item when all you taste is grisly, overseasoned & overcooked meat. Egg is lost in the burro's ill-flavored meat. Too bad.
