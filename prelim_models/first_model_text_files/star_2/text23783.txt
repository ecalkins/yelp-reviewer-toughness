Cons: The cashier was all over the place, more concerned with discussing personal matters with his co workers, my smoothie was not a smoothie but instead chunks of ice blended with some syrup and when I went to take a sip nothing came up or out because the shards were to big and blocking the straw. My grilled cheese was slapped together with uneven portions of cheese and one sorry sad looking piece of ham (nothing like the picture) now I get that is rarely the case that you get what's in the image but seriously......I will not be going the only reason I was nice and provided two stars is because the manger was nice and apologized and provided a fresh tea for my awful experience but they've surely left a bad taste in my mind; off to Dutch Bros!"
