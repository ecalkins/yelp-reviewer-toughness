Which is especially annoying when you have kids and the staff is totally apathetic and acts like it's normal to wait that long. And when the food came out, it wasn't even hot.  The burger had hardly any slaw or sauce on it and after paying $5.50 for the lucky charms shake, we were hoping it would be something special but no, it was basically a vanilla shake with whipped cream and a couple marshmallows on top. The sweet potato tots were the best thing there but their ranch sauce was weirdly thick and didn't have hardly any flavor. So I don't think we will be back and we're disappointed.
