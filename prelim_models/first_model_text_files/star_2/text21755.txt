In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back.
