Put my name on the waitlist and waited for an hour for a table. It was my brother's birthday and I asked the hostess to tell our server to bring out two pizookies for his birthday. I sit down at the table with an empty cocktail glass and still wait at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. My server finally stops over and says are you waiting on three more and I said yes and proceeds to not come back for about 15 minutes until the other 2 in my party arrives. We don't get a Hi how are you? we get are you ready to to order?. We had to ask for water and said we needed another minute but he never even offered to refill my cocktail. When we ordered I had to ask for a glass of wine, which he had forgotten about for 20 minutes and I had to remind him. Food came out pretty quick  but he never even asked how it was. My boyfriend joined half way thru the meal and the server didnt come back until we were done with dinner. He had to ask to order a drink from the server, who didn't even offer me another glass of wine. Its about 945 at this time and hes nowhere to be seen- probably doing sidework so he can leave. He finally comes back and asks what kind of pazookies we wanted....which I had already told the hostess....so it could be a surprise, but nope! That was ruined too. He drops the check, and I tipped him a generous 15% considering the service. Comes back immediately to pick it up and takes all of our glassware to the bar to be cleaned but leaves our 3 stacks of dirty plates. I don't want to pull the card but I'm a restaurant manager and if I knew one of my servers gave such atrocious service, I'd fire them.
