I tried to put all cultural differences aside, but the floors were filthy, an older woman seated with her family had her shoes off and was rubbing her feet on the floor, while a young couple across the way was eating as Mom was brushing knots out of her 7 year old daughter's hair and putting rubberbands from her mouth in her braids.   Lost my appetite.  Not certain I will ever go back and I feel terrible to say it since its such a wonderful Mom n Pop establishment and they are so friendly.
