I was informed they now have a $50 minimum for phone orders....outrageous!  When I asked why, they said because too many people place orders then don't show up.  (They probably did but got tired of waiting in the drive thru and left.)  I find it hard to believe they would prefer to get burned on a $50 order vs a $6 order....just doesn't make sense.   I then asked how backed up the drive thru is, was informed there were 4 cars which usually means a 30-45 minute wait.   Fagettaboutit!  I'll order a gyro from Mr Z instead
