One day (months ago) I try one. Hmmm I haven't missed a darn thing is my conclusion. It hasn't grown on me. I've not been tempted to return. I've been repelled to avoid it is more like what happened. All desire to experience it again was removed by one visit to this lame enterprise. Nothing is cool about it, fun about it, or great. I love burgers and fries, can eat them three or more times a week if I allowed myself, however this place doesn't do the great American meal any justice, sorry they could fold up and close their doors without making a blip on any radar screen of dining experience.
