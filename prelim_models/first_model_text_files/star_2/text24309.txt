Ordered the Oregano's Classic salad w chicken, an order of golden wings extra crispy, and Brussels sprouts.  Let me just say, the Brussels sprouts are the only redeeming part of this meal...the wings are not only not extra crispy, they are literally cold and soggy.  Blech.  The salad is also not good, the lettuce is wilted and black on the edges...it's basically inedible.  The Brussels are great, however!  I think the issue w the wings is that, when we arrived to pick it up, they were already done but were ""waiting on the salad""...which took 20 more minutes!  Not sure why the salad was prepared after the wings, but having them sit in a plastic takeout container while a salad was prepared, didn't probably do them any justice.  I hate giving bad reviews, I really do...especially to places I normally love...but this was disappointing tonight...so much so that I've ordered a salad and wings from another restaurant.  Eek!"
