They did have a cool special this week which was like a Mai Thai burger.  I probably should have tried it instead of just a regular burger.  The Mai Thai is two beef patties, rum glazed onions, pineapple and Serano pico, coconut crusted avocado, green chili aoili, and smoked mozzarella for $9.50 which seems like a much better value."
