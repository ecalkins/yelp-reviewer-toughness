We were seated quickly but the tables were way too crowded. We were a group of 6 but if we were 8 we wouldn't have been able to fit (even though there were 8 chairs) because we were right up to the next table. Pretty uncomfortable if you ask me. 

Also it is so loud here it's hard to do anything except eat. 

Food is jus pretty bad. It's typical dim sum but a lot of stuff is cold, greasy, and overlooked. If not that, it's just way overpriced. 

If you want a nice ambience and good dim sum go to Mekong."
