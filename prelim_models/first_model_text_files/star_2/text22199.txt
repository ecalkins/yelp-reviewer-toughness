Long story short, we are sat right away in the bar area and told by who I am assuming was a manager that the server would take care of us and get us out quickly (he knew we were on a break). Our order is taken and literally 50 min later our food comes out. We had to eat our food so fast and bolt out of there to get back in time. All of us ordered wings with the exception of one burger. A couple of us also got salads which came out at the same time as the wings, not sure why it wasn't brought out prior. Anyways, very disappointing especially since we made it pretty clear we didnt have too long and worse it was acknowledged by the manager. 

I would kind of understand if they were super busy and slammed but they werent. There was no line and there were more than a handful of empty tables. 

Love thier wings but I'm sure it would have tasted better if I didnt have to inhale them so fast."
