I got a regular cheeseburger with havarti cheese and my wife got their regular hamburger. I was not a fan of the meat. Really thin patties, I usually prefer a bigger patty so it can be cooked to a medium temperature. It also had a really strong charbroiled, smokey flavor which I usually don't mind but it was slightly overwhelming. The bun was delicious though, really soft and butter and probably the best thing here. 

Fries were really crispy which I love but they really over did it on the seasoned salt. Jalapeño ranch was underwhelming. I wanted more of a kick from the jalapeño and it tasted more sour cream based so it was pretty thick. Maybe I would return to try one of their specialty burgers like the burger brûlée. My buddy really wants me to try this burger so to make him happy I might go with him and give it another try."
