0	Let's start  disappointed I went back to the store to purchase some clearance items as I realize all of them were marked SOLD!!  I grabbed a few little household items that I needed  and I was in the process checking out and I began a conversation with the cashier in which her and Coworkers bragging that they were the ones that purchase all the clearance items, why even have them out for sale!!  the employees and manager don't care about customers if that's the way they're going to go about doing business, anyways that's my two cents thank you have a good day!!!
