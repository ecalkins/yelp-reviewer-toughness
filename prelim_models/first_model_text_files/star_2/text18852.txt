The wait staff is using a swatter to kill flies inside the restaurant and that grossed me out while I was eating. When I saw that, I lost my appetite and didn't want to finish the pho. Overall, in my personal opinion is this place is dirty and the restaurant serves low quality food. If you want cheap food go here. This place makes me want to be vegetarian again!
