Followed up with the crab bisque. Had to ask for cracked pepper instead of the server asking. Really needed something to add flavor which was lacking. 

Ordered the Prime Rib 16OZ cut rare but it came medium. Again No flavor. Definitely needed the au jus provided. 

Wife ordered the Filet and Crab Cake (pictured). I guess their idea of a filet is actually just a medallion. 

All this for the fine price of around $140 including tip. Not really worth it unless stuck with nowhere else to go."
