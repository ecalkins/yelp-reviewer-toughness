Not today though; 10 minutes before anyone asked me if I wanted anything to drink, 5 minutes till I got the drink. 25 minutes for my food to arrive and it was wrong. Would think in 25 minutes they could have at least gotten that right. The place wasn't overly busy as when I looked around to see if it was I saw several servers just standing at tables talking to customers for several minutes at a time. This tells me they felt it wasn't too busy so they could spend extra time chatting up customers. Hopefully this was just an off day for everyone working there.
