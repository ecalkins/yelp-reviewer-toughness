Buyer beware. If you order a deep dish and they get it wrong. Guess what? Ding ding ding. You got it. You are outta luck. You can wait another 45 mins or so waiting for your pizza to be remade while you eat a comped appetizer or salad... Mistakes for this establishment are very unforgiving. 

I appreciate they tried to make it right. But. After all that waiting... The pizza itself was petty disappointing and very much MEH. Can't say the pizza is good at all. So sad... 

Save your time and money. Go elsewhere."
