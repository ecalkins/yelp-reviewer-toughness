My burger was overcooked and flavorless. It was just a small ball of meat so only the middle of the sandwich had any meat. 

The toppings were fine...but nothing special. This place seems to be hyped up since it was featured on the food network with Guy Fieri....but as usual, when I go to those places I see on the food network, I'm disappointed. 

I will say that we enjoyed the sides. The sweet potato tots AND the homemade chips were excellent. BUT I probably won't be coming back to this place."
