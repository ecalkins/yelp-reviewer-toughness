The waitress was rude, delayed placing our order, and did not check on our table during the meal.  Most of all, it was very disappointing when we had to return 2 minutes after we left because a member of our party left his wallet at the table.  The table was not bussed yet when we returned but the check was picked up.  Since the wallet was not where he left it, we asked the waitress who claimed she did not notice a wallet.  As soon as we asked to see the manager, she returned with the wallet instead.  Very disappointing as our perception is that she intended to keep if had we not asked to see the manager.
