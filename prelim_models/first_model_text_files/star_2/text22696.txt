Now I know why people say that - because there is literally NO other place for dim sum within a 20 mile radius at least. Service was meh, and the food was very inconsistent. Some of it was warm while others (such as the turnip cake) were cold. Decor was lacking and it was very dark and dingy on the inside. It was the kind of venue where you would have a cheap Chinese or Vietnamese wedding and you can tell right away that it's cheap. I likely won't be coming back as I'd rather drive the extra 20 minutes to get better dim sum in Mesa or Chandler.
