When I worked at PV mall I felt positively fancy to eat salad and bread sticks for lunch here.  And at $3.95 it was quite the bargain when it wasn't an official lunch menu item.  Now they've made it $5.95 for soup and salad w/ breadsticks which still isn't a bad deal.  But now of course it doesn't taste quite as good as when I thought it was healthy.

As for the other food, I was turned off when I had 2 different friends work there who specifically told me not to go there.  Well, not that it was bad or I'd get sick, but that it was to Italian food what Taco Bell was to Mexican food.  When they said that if I could microwave, I could cook at Olive Garden, I decided to trust them.  I'll admit I've been a few times with them when I'm with other folks who really really wanted to go.  The last time I went was maybe 9 months ago and what really struck me were the prices.  I can get fresh ingredients and real cooking for that price - and generally better service.  

The best thing I can say about this place is how many jobs it's given my friends over the years because they have such an amazing turn over they will hire just about anyone.  This is a great place to get a job to get server experience.  And once you've learned the art of hospitaliano, you can go get a better job.  Just like everyone else.  But it will still take at least 3 months for the smell of Olive Garden to get out of your clothes and your car."
