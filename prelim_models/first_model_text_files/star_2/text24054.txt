BUT Every time I come in it's something.  Bad service, slow service, wrong order, cold food, stringy, chewy chicken and now this time I order the beef terriyaki bowl only to get it back to work and find that there are little red wiry  hairs (about 1/4 to half inch in length) strewn throughout the meal.  Disgusting!!!       I have no idea what they are....human, animal?? They have the texture of whiskers.  I don't even want to know where they came from, all I know is...I'M DONE!  No more.  I threw away my $7 lunch and ate chips out of the machine for lunch. I hate to say this but this time I WON'T BE BACK!  
Good look to the rest of you!"
