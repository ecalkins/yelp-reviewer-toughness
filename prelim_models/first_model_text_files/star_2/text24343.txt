Unlike most of the reviews, I had absolutely no wait because I called in the order to go. The lady who answered the phone was very pleasant, but was puzzled as to why I didn't want marinara sauce with my calamari and garlic bread. I'm not a fan of sauces.

I should have trusted my instinct and passed on the food that apparently had a ""sauce requirement"", but I was hungry and wanted calamari. The menu said ""calamari rings"" but it was strips, with way too much breading. I won't grade down on the sogginess, mainly because it was in a plastic container, steaming hot, for 15 minutes before I ate it. Sogginess aside, the calamari was more breading than meat, and just laid there staring at me, wondering why I didn't smother it in the required marinara sauce. The garlic bread was average. 

The staff was pleasant, the portion sizes are good for the price, and there was reasonable parking, but since it was almost 8pm that should be a given.  I may try Oregano's again, but not anytime soon."
