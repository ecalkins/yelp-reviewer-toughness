First we sat down and our bartender was sweet, but she wasn't up to date with her knowledge on their wine or beer. I ordered the Dark Horse Cabernet after debating on what I was drinking for a good 10 min, the bartender said she didn't have it. THEN my friend went to order the Black Panther Stout I believe after she took forever to decide as well, and the bartender poured her an Amber ale, thinking we didn't know our beers. I told her that what she poured was not a stout, and she said ""Oh, sorry, we don't have that anymore."" REALLY? I won't mention her name because I'm not trying to get someone fired or in trouble. But TELL the customers what you're out of before they sit there and read the menu. Common sense sister. 

So on top of those two things, we can see in the server station, and one of the servers is blowing his nose, right in front of the customers! I nearly threw up!  I would never eat there after that experience! 

Your company really needs to get it together! I wouldn't return unless I ordered a bottled beer and to watch a football game!"
