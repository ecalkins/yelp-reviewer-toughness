There was only one choice of noodles.the service was slow and they only came by once in an hour.  Several of the dishes were sitting for one hour on the place was overcooked.    The place was more like a 9.00 buffet.  The noodles we did have was not gre but did not have any flavor.  I tried to get ice cream but the line was too long
