It had been a few years since we were last at Romano's Macaroni Grill, since we have been swept off our feet by the many other great Italian restaurants around, but the 2-tapas and 2 entrees for $25 enticed us back for another try.  It's a good deal but the chef attention was not in evidence.  You have your choice of 6 tapas or 8 entrees, and can choose from any of the regular entrees for $3 more.  At happy hour the drinks are also a bargain. Though the Margarita Prima was a bit sour for my taste, it may be just right for some.

The highlight of the meal was the bread.  The ciabatta delivered with our drinks was as good as they get.  From there, it was all downhill.  The concepts were great, but the flavor was completely lacking.  

Our tapas, the artichoke potato cakes and zucchini fritti were generic fried pub food lacking any Italian imagination.

I had the pasta carbonara, which looked wonderful, and the poached egg on top is the perfect touch, but there was no flavor whatsoever to the sauce.  Even the pancetta lacked flavor.  Having just returned from Italy where I had some really great carbonara, I was completely let down.  My wife had Carmela's chicken, in which we could find no hint of the advertised carmelized onion, and the chicken tasted as though it had been processed to death and butchered weeks ago.

Fortunately, I was able to revive my taste buds with a good chocolate gelato before departing leaving half-empty plates and no desire for a doggy bag."
