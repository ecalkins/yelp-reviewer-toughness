I prefer Frys in general but his particular store never has what I'm looking for and the service staff is always rude. I mean, i get it, The life of a grocery store cashier isn't always glamorous and I know it's hard work. But it's not my fault your having a bad day. 

From now on, I'll got the Frys at 40th and thunderbird and make a second stop at sprouts for my health food store needs."
