We asked for a side of Stand Sauce and didn't receive it, so we had to turn around and get it. 50 cents for the equivalent of a ketchup packet... no thanks. It's ripped off spread, anyway.

The burgers were okay, but they kind of crumbled while we ate them. The fries were tasteless, greasy, and undercooked. I liked my gluten-free bun and jalapenos, but they weren't worth the additional charge.

I'm not sure why this place is so popular. The Stand is obviously trying to reinvent the wheel, and mostly fails miserably. Just go to In-N-Out, where you know you'll get good service, a correct order, and good food."
