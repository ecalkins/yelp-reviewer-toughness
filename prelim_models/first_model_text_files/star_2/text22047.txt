We sat at the bar ready to eat, drink and watch the Gold Cup soccer match. The bartender seemed lost and disinterested in what we wanted. She had 3 customers seated and took her time bringing a menu and searching for the game for us. After 10 minutes of this we left. If I return and she's behind the bar, I'm not going to waste my time again
