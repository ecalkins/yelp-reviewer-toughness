First time was fine because it was busy and there were workers walking around
However this time there are open tables and the service has gotten worse, as in when we walked in the host walked away bearly saying a word and practically threw the menues on the table and walked away. They took our order and were out of my gf's first choice. Then when the garneshes were brought they forgot the culantro (sp). Our water glasses were empty as i asked for the culantro (again sp), they brought a small plate of a few leves that was fine for me, and did not fill the water cups.

I have been going to pho restaurants for years in Hi and Az, this will be our last time dining here, or maybe 3rd times a charm if we do not find a better place"
