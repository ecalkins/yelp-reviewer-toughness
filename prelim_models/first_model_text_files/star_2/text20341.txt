No more wait service. Instead you awkwardly order at the counter.

Prices have gone up drastically! 

Pretty much the same menu but it tastes different. Not nearly as flavorful. My sushi roll was quite sloppy. 

No booze! Booooooo. Supposedly they are waiting on a liquor license but if I had a buzz I probably would have been much more forgiving of the experience. 

I will still give them 2 stars because the counter guy was nice and the food was edible. But it was a bad experience... Usually when my husband and I hit up their happy hour we pay under $25 for tasty nibbles and a few alcoholic beverages. This time our bill was almost $40 for similar items but not as tasty but without the booze and without table service. Boooooooo!"
