Watch out and ask about the dish, because the menu does not tell you anything about what you are ordering. This place feels very low budget. The wok vegetable Chinese green means you only get a plate full of 1 type of vegetable...

Their food was depressing and has now been my worst Chinese restaurant experience so far."
