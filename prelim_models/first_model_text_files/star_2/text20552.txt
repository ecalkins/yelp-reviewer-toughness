I had a chicken scallopini, which is usually my go-to dish at this restaurant. They forgot to put capers on it (clearly states capers in the menu listing) and there were some cooked red things (cherries maybe) on there that typically aren't present. The worst of it, though, was that this dish was absolutely drowned in butter to the point of being disgusting. That's a huge problem with these chain restaurants -- you'd never get that from a mom & pop restaurant. Good food does NOT need to be saturated in butter to have flavor. Further, I ordered coffee afterward and it was lukewarm. The server's solution, instead of popping it into a microwave for 30 seconds, was to add hot water to it, which really wasn't a success as the coffee was still barely warm. There are a lot of things I can give a restaurant a pass on but bad coffee is not one. Every server knows, or should know, that coffee needs to be A)hot and B)fresh. For this experience, I give this restaurant a D.
