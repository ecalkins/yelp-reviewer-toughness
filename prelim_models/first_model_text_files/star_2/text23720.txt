I ordered a veggie and a chicken taco, they came out quickly and tasted very fresh and flavorful. Unfortunately there was a big bone in my chicken taco. I hurt my tooth and tried to let a worker here know and I was shocked at her reaction. She looked at me, never apologized and acted annoyed that she did not apologize or even offer to fix the situation. I had even mentioned it to her. I probably won't be back based on the lack of customer service.
