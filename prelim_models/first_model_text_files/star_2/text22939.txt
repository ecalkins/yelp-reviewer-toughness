When you go to the stand you know it's going to be a wait for your food. Like 10-15 mins for a shake or taco, that type of wait. Which is fine, it's all hand made. 

Last night we went to the drive through to order a couple tacos. Waited for 20 minutes in the drive through line. Only to get up to the window to say hey I'm sorry we don't have the taco you ordered.... You can see how that would be annoying. Pretty bad customer service."
