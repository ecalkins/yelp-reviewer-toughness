I order my food and when I'm done, the girl taking my order tells me the total. Hello? My fiancé is going to eat too lol! I'm like uh... my fiancé is standing right next to me he's also going to order. So we order then sit. 5 min later my fiancé's teriyaki bowl comes out. 15 minutes later still no food for me. I walk up to the counter and ask them WWWHHHYYYYYYYY they would bring my fiancé's food FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE MY FOOD comes out (and my food hasn't even came out yet). So she goes to the back and my food is sitting there, ready. Come on people. Get it together. Not coming back here again. The food was okay though.
