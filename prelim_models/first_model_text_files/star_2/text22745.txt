The burgers were overcooked from what we asked and mostly flavorless. I got the white truffle Swiss burger which had almost no mushrooms on it and I couldn't even taste the aioli.  I'm not sure if the meat was seasoned or not but all I could taste was the caramelized onion. My brother had the California burger and agreed that the meat was flavorless. The side of roasted vegetables was actually pretty good along with the romesco sauce, but the fries seemed premade. Overall it was okay but did not seem to match the price point. There are other burger places at a similar price that I would rather have.
