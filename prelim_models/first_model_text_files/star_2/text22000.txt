The first 16 miles of the hike over South Mountain from Ahwatukee is scenic, peaceful, and enjoyable.  But the last couple of miles of trail off the mountain to the restaurant and casino are not well marked, creating an unnecessary detour to reach the restaurant.  

Worse, the restaurant does not clearly advertise that they are closed on Tuesdays, leaving you mighty hungry for the 18 mile hike back home."
