I was so very excited to check out Da Vang as I am a Vietnamese food nut and have longed to find a decent joint here in the valley. Da Vang is not that place.

Let me clear this up first. When I say that I'm a Vietnamese food nut I am not joking. I used to eat Vietnamese two or three times a week, there were eight (!) Vietnamese restaurants within a block of my house back home, my best friend is Vietnamese and his mother and sister cook for me when I go back for a visit. I know my Bun from my Banh, Pho realz.

Let's start with the good. The Bun was indeed tasty, well prepared and inexpensive like Bun should be.

Now for the bad. The service was terrible, they were out of bbq pork, they mixed up the salt and sugar in my drink (a briny drink is not where it's at, fyi) and their Banh Xeo was an abomination that likely would have begged for death if it could speak.

I wish that I could say that I had found my Vietnamese oasis in the dull and bland desert but I have not. My search continues and so should yours."
