First of all, no alcohol. Now, we aren't a bunch of alcoholics, but when the kids are all bowling it's nice to have a cocktail or two and chat amongst the adults. & if we just want to go on a date night... it'd be nice to have a cocktail then, too! But oh well, we got past that part.

I understand this is a new place & it will probably get better as time goes on but WOW, I think I know more about serving than our actual server... inexperienced joke.

The service wasn't exceptional, but the food was pretty darn good I must say! The only thing is that when you order the boneless wings (which were delicious), make sure you aren't expecting any extra wing sauce because they DONT SERVE IT. What??? It says on the menu, ask for an extra dipping sauce to go with your wings! Yet... they don't even have sides of BBQ sauce... what a crock!!! 

This place pretty much just pissed me off all night long, but the kids had a good time so I guess theyre doing something right...."
