There must be a new sushi maker because the California roll we ordered looked awful. It tasted okay, but there was something off about the presentation. The couple sitting behind us also had a problem with the California roll. We both ordered the Tokyo Chicken Slaw and it took forever to get to our table. The chefs must still be learning how to make all of the dishes.

We like going to Eastwind because of the location and the food. Now we'll start going to Cherry Blossom more often for our Japanese fix."
