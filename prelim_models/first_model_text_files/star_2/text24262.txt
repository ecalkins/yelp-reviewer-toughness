The Chicago deep dish took a looooong time to come out and had a crust like leather (no exaggeration).  We sent it back and got a thin crust, the manager was very good about taking care of us as customers.  But the kitchen staff must have gotten irritated because I and another two in our party came down ill immediately afterward with indigestion to nausea.   We've all agreed we are too nervous to return to this location, but will go back to the Scottsdale and Shea restaurant which has given us great food and service on every occasion.
