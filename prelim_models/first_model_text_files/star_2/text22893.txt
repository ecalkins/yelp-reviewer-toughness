I had to wait around 5 mins...no big deal, I want fresh food. The burger was huge and had double patties. Everything about it was bland. The burger tasted purely like grease, the lettuce tasted dirty and it was just plain gross. I'm new to the area and really wanted to try out and support local businesses, however this place  will not get my support. My stomach felt queezy the rest of the evening, I'm sure due to the abundance of grease. It dripped from the burger and every bite just seemed like a bland  deep fryer mess. In and out and Culvers have way better burgers for much less. I paid 6.00 for just the burger here and I would pay more if it was a good burger, but the stand just isn't up to my standards. Soo disappointed. Looks like I'm still on the search for a good local burger joint close to my house.
