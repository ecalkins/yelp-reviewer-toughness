I had the won ton soup, house fried rice and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The won tons were cool in the middle and the soup had frozen veggies in it - I have never seen won ton soup with peas.  

The house fried rice was flat and greasy.  My dinner companion commented that the house fried rice was more like what you find on the east coast, if that means anything to you.

The sauce ion the broccoli was twice as salty as they soy sauce.  Frankly, I was just really unimpressed.  I won't be back.

Does anyone know where to get good Chinese in Phoenix, because I sure don't."
