0	This location has some serious AC issues.  It's either 20 degrees too warm or 20 degrees to cold.  Customers all talk about it but nothing seems to ever get done about it.  The building is really 2 separate rooms.  1 is where you order your drinks and the other is where the sitting area is.  It feels like 2 completely different temperature zones.  They would benefit from a visit from someone to fix their thermostat issues.
