Anything more than that is sure to dissapoint anyone and everyone with an even remotely refined taste for Japanese cuisine. The sushi, sashimi and specialty rolls are generic and uninspired. The attention to detail, care in preparation and harmony of flavors - that generally make Japanese cuisine so special - is altogether absent. And the freshness, or lack thereof, is downright concerning. All of this is especially disappointing because this is such a good location and space for a quality Japanese place.
