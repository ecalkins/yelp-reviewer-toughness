0	small menu.  too pricey.  I've had bigger and better burgers for that price.  the little girl who took my order wanted to know if I was going to add gratuity to my $27 bill.  for what?  you just took my order.  you didn't wait on me hand and foot.  I ordered to go.  the taco was so small I needed a magnifying glass to find it in the bottom of the bag.  the dulce de leche shake:  I told my son I could open up a can of that stuff at home for cheaper.
