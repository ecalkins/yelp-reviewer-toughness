I've heard good things about this place on yelp, so we decided to have dinner here. 
I'm sorry, but this place is sad! 
I hate giving 2 star ratings especially if it's a family owned business, but their service needs improvement! 
When we sat down, nobody bothered to check on us or even offer us water. 
After waiting and being ignored for about 5 minutes, we finally waved someone to give us water . Our waiter seemed a little impatient and when we ordered our drinks, the server just threw our beverages on the table, turned around and then walked away. 
We were like, what is his problem? Maybe he had a long day, but that's no excuse! 
When he finally took our order, half of the things I ordered weren't available. He kept saying they ran out and he seemed very short with me.
Then why put 100 items in the menu if half of the items are not available?
I am always nice to service industry, but this dude didn't even bother suggesting an alternate selection.
Sage ordered a beef pho and I ordered a vegetarian noodle with tofu and vegetables. This place is not vegan friendly and all their pho is made with beef stock. Most of their dishes either contains animal tendons, pigs blood, tripe and other things i couldn't identify.   
Then when we got our food, he didn't even bother to check on us to see if everything was satisfactory. 
I don't know why this place get 5 stars. It's not even a 5 star restaurant. It's in a sketchy strip mall and the restaurant is dirty. Stained ceilings and filthy floors. I would be scared to find out what the kitchen looks like. 
Sure you get good value for your money and they give you large portions, but the service and atmosphere left much to be desired."
