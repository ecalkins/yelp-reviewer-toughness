I went with some friends, we got seated and they brought us water and menus so it started great. They took about 20min just to come back to take our orders and I get it busy, we went on Sunday and the place was pack but wouldn't it be faster for them if they had faster service. Then another 30-45min to bring our food we had asked for more water too and they brought the food but no water. We reminded the server but after the food was delivered we didn't see him again! He didn't came to check if everything was fine, he never delivered the water and we had to get up and asked for the check our selves. If the service would have been better I believe they would have gotten a 5 star in my book.
