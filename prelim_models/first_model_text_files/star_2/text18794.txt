I ordered tamarind soup and one of my friends ordered beef pho and the other ordered shrimp fried rice. everything was fine to start but myself and my friend who ordered shrimp fried rice both felt warm and uncomfortable after we ate. for me like my blood pressure was going up. then my friend said his stomache was bothering him and he said he does not want to go back to da vang. I know from past experiences that what was causing that was the use of MSG.  Again I really like this place, I wish they would stop using MSG and I would return in a heart beat. I know that they are not the only restaurant that uses MSG. But I also avoid other restaurants that use this artificial food contaminent. I hope Da Vang takes a moment and thinks about their health and the health of all of their customers and eliminates MSG."
