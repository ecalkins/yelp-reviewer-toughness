I've done dim sum many times but this was my first experience in the Phoenix area. I won't be going back.  Service was poor.  Food was underwhelming and too greasy.  Didn't see the usual options offered at dim sum.  I'm comparing to dim sum in The Bay Area, so that may not be fair, but the experience just wasn't worth it.
