I should have took these reviews serious. Let's start with the worse...the hash browns...so greasy and chewy one bite and I spit it out (GROSS) I know! On to the  maple brown sugar breakfast sandwich, I had know ideal it literally would be like you dipped the bacon in a bowl of sugar. I'm all about a savory/sweet combo but this was straight trash...one word DISGUSTING. Needless to say I will be sticking to my small frozen iced coffee once a month and leave it at that."
