The burger was awful (frozen, completely unseasoned, hard to chew!, and with an off taste), the ""southwest philly"" sandwich was worse (tasteless and mushy), the (frozen) onion rings were crisp but the onions themselves were total mush. Fries were average. Fried pickles, so so. Cheese curds the same. Stick with the wings and beer.  Sit at the bar (the bartenders have been great, but don't even think about a mixed drink or wine)."
