Well to start we had some bread brought to are table which was very good but was all gone by the time I got my chicken & mushroom cannolloni.They should have offered more bread when everyone one got there pasta or soup. (minus a star) food was not hot enough (oops there goes another one) service when we were done was very slow and I was still hungry (down to 2 stars) I will stop writing before they run out of stars. (will not return).
