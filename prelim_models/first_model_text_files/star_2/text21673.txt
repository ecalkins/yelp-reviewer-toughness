I almost feel like people only go here because it was on Triple D. Don't get me wrong, the establishment itself was nice and the staff were friendly but the food wasn't even close to what I expected. I was hyped up off of the food network and even the presentation,but it lacks flavor. I got the booze burger but my burger was majority breaking/batter. The bun is too small for the burger and the burger itself tasted like it had no seasoning. The seasoned fries were good but the portion size was disappointing. My wife got a burger with a fried egg on it that wound up being sunny side up smh. I doubt I would return based on quality of the food and I drove close to 30 minutes coming from Scottsdale.
