The only reason I went last weekend is because our very kind neighbor gave us a gift card for Christmas that we haven't used. We should have regifted. 

Let's start with the breadsticks. Salty and drab. Maybe I just got spoiled with other Italian eateries that give you a loaf of fresh bread and either herb butter or herbed olive oil. These are covered with garlic SALT. 

My husband had the salad which was decent, but c'mon. Their dressing is so commercialized now. I had the minestrone soup which was, again, decent. Tastes like it's from a can.

I had the baked ziti which was flavorless. My husband had a chicken garlic pasta dish which is edible but, again, not great. 

Service was very good. I feel sorry for the waiter for having to work at Olive Garden. He should take his good food service skills somewhere else.

I must share my experience at the OG from a couple years ago. I ordered the manicotti- which they don't have anymore. While eating I dug out a huge piece of plastic. The server got the manager who explained to me that it was a  plastic bag that the food comes in. She was extremely apathetic about the whole situation and I only got comped for my meal. 

People can save alot of money by skipping a trip to the Olive Garden and buying a Stouffers frozen Italian meal. If you do want to spend money on a good Italian meal check out the ma and pop local Italian places. Roma Garden and Aiello's are a good start. They are the same price for real homemade Italian food."
