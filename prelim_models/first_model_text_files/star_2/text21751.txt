I had the appetizer platter as a meal (shared with my companion), preceded by ""hot-and-sour"" soup, which was neither. The ""spring rolls"" were what I call egg rolls and the filling was greasy - it was as if they were fried at too low a temperature, allowing the oil to be absorbed into the food before it finished cooking. The paper-wrapped (well, foil-wrapped) chicken was of a strange consistency - it was almost fluffy, like ground meat bound with egg and poached. The crab puffs were oily and their filling was a sticky paste, albeit flavorful. The tempura shrimp (when did tempura become Chinese?) were oil-soaked, like the spring rolls. The beef ribs were very gristly, and the beef skewers were OK - probably the best item on there. My fellow diner had the orange chicken, which had good flavor, but the consistency of the orange-peel bits in the dish was really hard - I chewed some for the flavor but decided I didn't care to swallow them, any more than I would deliberately swallow olive pits. Only white rice was offered with the orange chicken. We stuck to water and hot tea to drink, and the tea was good - plus it helped cut the oil and get the greasy taste out of my mouth. The service was fine, it was a Tuesday evening and not too busy; the cost was fair for the amount, if not the quality, of the food. I am a big fan of chow fun, and several other reviewers mentioned that theirs is good, so I might go back to try that, but since it has taken me six years to get there this first time (since I moved back to Phoenix) it may take a while."
