I don't know what good a large selection of sushi does you if it isn't very good.  Of the eight types I sampled, one was decent (crispy onion tuna, despite having only a tiny morsel of fish).  The other seven were fair.  A big problem is that even at 6pm, when things should be really fresh, they weren't.

The tempura was very oily, the non-fish dishes (orange chicken, chicken with mushrooms, broccoli beef) were nowhere near as tasty as those you get at a shopping center food court.  And how did Jasmine Tokyo manage to make roasted duck with skin that was crispy and chewy at the same time?  (I'll tell you how -- it had been sitting around for hours).

Seasoning is not a talent of the food preparers (I will not call them chefs) -- the spicy tuna was not spicy, nothing had salt or other condiments that I could discern, and so on and so on and so on.

Don't save your appetite for desert -- it is pedestrian at best and has nothing to do with the Orient.

A few things were okay, namely those where good ingredients and decent recipes are all that is needed -- the plain shrimp, the custard, the hot and sour soup.  That's about it.

$22 for this?? Even with 20% off, it's still at least $10 overpriced."
