So far the best place for Banh Cuon is Banh Cuon Tay Ho in the Westminster area of Orange County CA. I was hoping to find something comparable in the Phoenix AZ area.
I was really glad to see all the good reviews about this place. Even though the atmosphere left much to be desired (most Vietnamese restaurants do), I was still hoping for the food to make up for the location and decor. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the Banh Cuon they served. It was not good. It wasn't fresh. The other dishes were jusokay. I would not come back."
