As we walked in we stood around for a while trying to figure out if we should sit or wait to be seated,  Later I realized that the regulars just walk in hold their hand up with the # of people and get seated.  We went with the traditional beef pho which was very bland.  The kiddo thought the broth had a seafood flavor and I may agree.  We are pho snobs and this was a disappointment.  Hubby had the crunchy noodles with chicken that turn soft with the sauce it comes with.  That was pretty good.  The other kid and I had the pepper beef which was really oily and I thought the menu said spicy but it wasn't.  It was really thin beef with green pepper chunks and sliced onion.  It also came with white rice which seemed old, it was dry.  We also tried to start with crunchy egg rolls and spring rolls, but on this night service was pretty quick so it all came out together.  The service was efficient, and the price was really nice but flavor was lacking, at least for us.  As a family, we gave it a c+ and not coming back.
