It also showed it was affordable. So hey why not try. We first pull up and the parking is chaos. No light whatsoever and barely any room to park. So we go in and the place looks cute. As we look at the menu they really don't have much options. We both ordered chicken tacos and an horchata water. As we go to our booth I notice something weird on the wall and roof. Come to find out they were flies!!!!! Lots of them. Disgusting dirty flies all over the wall and roof. My husband brings it to the attention to one of the employees and she says ""oh it's okay they don't go near the food."" 20 min later we get our tacos and they are of decent size but for less than that I can get delicious AUTHENTIC Mexican tacos. Because being from Mexico City I can guarantee these are not authentic. The chicken taste like can food chicken. Oh and the water taste like milkshake not horchata!!!!! So in conclusion please save your time and money and go somewhere with actual Mexican tacos oh and that doesn't have flies. Yuck!"
