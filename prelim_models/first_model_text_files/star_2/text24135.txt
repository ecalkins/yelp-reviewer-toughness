Unfortunately we were underwhelmed: almost all the tables were not wiped down, the fish sandwich had no sauce on it (had to ask for tartar sauce), and the Wisconsin patty melt was bland.  One last personal strike although this isn't about food but ambience; blaring country music is not my first choice.  Normally we give everything a second chance but why bother when there are so many good burger places out there?
