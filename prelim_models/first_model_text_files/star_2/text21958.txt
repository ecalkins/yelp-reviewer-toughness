One of the baristas gave me a hard time about getting soy in my coffee? He thought he was being funny but seriously.. You work in customer service, your sarcastic responses to my request are unnecessary. Also? If you're not busy, an iced coffee shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to prepare.... Just saying. Considering the other reviews, this appears to be a recurrent issue."
