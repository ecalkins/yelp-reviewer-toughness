I adore the Soup, Salad and Bread sticks for lunch but the last couple of times I ate at the Cactus location the bread lacked garlic and was only a salt fest. I stopped eating here when they made people wait to be seated, with the restaurant only half empty at 4:45 PM. I eat out with some older individuals and this restaurant consistently made us wait when most of their seats were empty.  I have tried the spaghetti and lasagna a few times but can make better ones rather easily. Fortunately they have added back the ""grilled sausage and peppers rustica dish"" as it is much better than most of the other menu items."
