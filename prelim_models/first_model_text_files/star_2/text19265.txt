Something is ALWAYS shut down or broken but they don't tell you until AFTER you've paid money to play/bowl etc. This has happened on 2 out of 3 visits here over the last 2 months. The first time we paid for cosmic bowling but the lights were broken on the lane we were given and we were told to basically deal with it or wait an hour for another lane (after paying of course!) The second time 2 of the 4 lanes in the mini bowl area were out of order (no signs and no one told us) and the other lanes were occupied with multiple families. Each time I've tired to discuss my frustrations with an employee, or worse, a ""Manager"", they don't attempt to understand your feelings and tell you to use your money towards another attraction. Bryan was the least helpful of all so far! As another side note, the restrooms are always filthy and getting so much as a soda or snack can take 45 minutes or more. My kids love this place but this will probably be my last visit due to the lack of care for the place and the major lack of concern from management and employees for their patrons."
