I hate the way you can't get multiple sauces (unlike native and wing stop) unless you order a massive amount. They even charge you for more ranch! We ordered nachos with our wings and they forgot to bring out the chicken. Rather than take it back and add it they just brought out a tray of chicken separately and he was to throw it on top covering up all the chips and having so sauce on the chicken. When we left the server had charged us for a Coors light we didn't have so we had to wait for the bill to be fixed. The place is over priced for wings which can be ordered anywhere. Beer selection sucks too if youre a craft beer drinker.
