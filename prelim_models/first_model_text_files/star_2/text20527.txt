Bottom line- If I didn't have a $25 gift card, I would have been very disappointed for paying 50 dollars for an ""Olive Garden"" meal I could have gotten for 25 bucks. Food was OK/good, Wife had eggplant Parm, while I did the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken. Had Calamari as an AP, (OK), and Caprese Salad, also just OK.

I don't think I'll go back, as I am a cheap bastard, and if I wanted to splurge, there are much better Italian joints in N. Scottsdale that I like more, that I am willing to fork out 20 bucks a meal for."
