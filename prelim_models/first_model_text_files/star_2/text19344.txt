We played some games and were checking out with the tickets. The lady handed me the whoopie cushion, I showed it to my nephew and he said he didn't want it. I looked at the lady and said I'd like something else. She told me no- that she had closed out the ticket already. Are you kidding me?!? It had been 30 seconds! I was literally still standing there looking at her and I couldn't change it for something else??? Now I have an upset 4 year old. I asked her if I could then buy something instead and she said no! I couldn't believe it. I mean come on if you're dealing with children you really need to be more accommodating. 

Also- after speaking to my sister I have found out that there have been similar issues with the level of service and wait times they have experienced. Looks like we may need to be looking for a different place to go next time."
