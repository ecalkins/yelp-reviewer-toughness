 I know better than to go to chains but some are good and this is close to home.

Beginnings, I asked waitress about something on the menu and she replied with she didn't know the menu that well??? 

Bread bomb they served was stale.

Salad with my entree came as.a shallow salad, barely cresting an inch from bottom of bowl! COME ON!  ($3.00) extra too!

Entree: $ 15.00  Shrimp with spinach & mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce. I was delivered a snarled blob of Pasta in a oil/sauce (I didn't taste any butter or lemon for that matter just a fattening tasteless conductor of lube/oil to help me swallow a bite. There was maybe 4 chards of spinach tangled in the  pasta and about 2 tablespoons of mushrooms in it, all for 15 dollars!!! Oh and I did get my shrimp but they were overcooked.

Value :ZERO,,,This is pasta for God sake, you'd think they might throw in a little extra spinach or mushrooms to go with it and actually use butter like they claim.
 Oh No,,they are in the back  with their weights and measures making certain no one gets an extra mushroom or spinach chard all the while balancing the books making sure their profits aren't marginal!"
