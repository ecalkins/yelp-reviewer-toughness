Felt like I was getting an overpriced in and out burger... $2.99 for a large drink and the small drink was $2.49 for my wife... Two hamburgers and two drinks One Fry $22.19 plus tax... Disappointed

After consulting with my wife we were talking about our experience and the lack of taste of the burgers... She said she would rather lick one of our cats feet after it got out of the litter box"
