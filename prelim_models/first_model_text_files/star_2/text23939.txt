Tables now have tablets which are useful for calling your waiter.  They also have games on them.  One of the games, Trivia, started running without our ever touching the device, so we played it.  Later our bill came and we find we had been charged $1.99 for using the game.  Only then did we go back to the menu, bring up the list of games, and see that virtually all of the games are listed as ""Premium Games"" but no mention is made of a charge or what that charge would be.  Our waiter never mentioned this to us either.

I feel that this ""sharp"" practice and the introduction of higher-priced menu items is an attempt by the new management to make a profit no matter how.  What else are they doing that we don't see? Better idea -- cut down on the absurdly large portion sizes."
