I am living close by and it was my preferred grocery store until recently. 
I am considering using a different store. 
My main complaint about this store is the lack of service when checking out. Since weeks I have to bag my own groceries and no help is in sight. 
Not even the cashiers are helping!!!
It would be so easy to scan and bag at the same time, but noooo....they just wait until you do it yourself. And I am not talking about a few items I bought...usually my cart is full to the top. 
Now after weeks of adjusting to the lack of service I almost prefer to bag my own groceries because then there isn't such a waste of plastic bags & I can organize my groceries better etc. and no one just throws the stuff into the bags like they used to do. 

On the positive side...the guys behind the meat counter & fish counter are the friendliest & most helpful people in this store."
