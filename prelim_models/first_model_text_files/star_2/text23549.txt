I was very excited for this place to open and overall disappointed with my experience here. They've done an excellent job with the space and it looks really great. But I have real issues with the food that the decor just cannot make up for. 

In my 3 visits, we've had each of the tacos, the burgers, the fries, and the milkshake (pretty much everything on the menu). The burger is whatever (is that american cheese?), the fries are good but nothing crazy and the store bought, dried out taco shells that break in half when you fold em is a straight up disaster. Factor in no beer and I will not be coming back here. 

Too bad. Being from the neighborhood I'd like to like this place. But as stated, a better burger and a better taco can be found just down the street....."
