Ok, here goes my opinion.....  The Patty -  was only a couple steps above an In & Out burger, taste-wise (kinda flavorless for being a BBQ marinated patty! I know I'm going on about the beef but hey, that is a vital component.... right!  One last thing if you're not a fan of sugar sprinkled fries ..... or whatever sweet stuff they use.  Let them know and they serve sans seasoning! I'm not a cheap skate but if I'm paying 8 plus bucks for a burger I set the bar/standard higher than an In & Out!
