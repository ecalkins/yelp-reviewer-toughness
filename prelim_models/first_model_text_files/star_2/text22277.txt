I sent for the manager to come out and he said ""it happens all the time here"" apparently feathers may be on any of your wings and this was not an isolated incident.

We did end up receiving a 25% discount on the whole order so not all was negative but I will not be going to Buffalo Wild Wings any time soon. Feathers just gross me out too much."
