Inside, there's a high table that looks towards the outside tables so if you're near the high table inside or outside, you're kind of in someone else's bubble.  Also, there are only 3 tables inside.  I normally eat where ever I go to lunch since I work nearby and bringing food back to the office doesn't really work.
