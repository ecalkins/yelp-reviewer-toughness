So I proceeded to go to the snack bar my self and the cashier said ""well you can order here."" My problem was that I had my kids with me and couldn't leave them to go order""  so she said she would send someone over . Well no one came. So I asked another employee and he said ""we are busy today"". I had never had this experience at any other bowling place I have ever gone !"
