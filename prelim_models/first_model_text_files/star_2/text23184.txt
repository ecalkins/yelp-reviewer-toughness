0	2 bacon burgers, 1 fry, 1 small soda.  Almost $25.  Bacon was thick but very hard.  Not a bad fast food burger, and fries pretty good but soooo not worth the price.  Burger seemed on par with smashburger or five guys I dont mind paying for quality but pretty disappointed in pricing.  Lots of burger options out there.  Wish I could go back in time and drive on past.  Wanted to try a shake but didn't want to spend another $6.  Food gets a 3 rating.  Seating area is small and uncomfortable if eating there.  Sorry Stand.  I felt ripped off.
