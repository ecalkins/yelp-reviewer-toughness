The patties were small, similar to a breakfast sausage patty. The country fried had no cheese and was 3/4 tomato and onion straw** see photo containing no patty left. The burger was bland and as mentioned by others the gravy on the side was runny like ranch. (So much so that we were dipping Tots in it before realizing.) The Brûlée had similar characteristics build-wise but was better tasting. 

Fries and tots were below average but were hot. They mixed up our fry/tot order but not that big of a deal I guess. 

All in all I won't be back. My girlfriends food wasn't awful but mine was. I can't imagine it making a tv show because it wasn't anything special. For $30 with tip I'm severely disappointed. Oh well, live and learn, hopefully I can help someone else with making their dinner choice."
