The Tempe location gives a scoop of tuna, this location gave a half scoop IF THAT. For $1 more you can drive over to ahi poke bowl and get 2 scoops plus way better rice and toppings. Wait time was long too and the man working the register clearly doesn't care about customer service. Won't be going back
