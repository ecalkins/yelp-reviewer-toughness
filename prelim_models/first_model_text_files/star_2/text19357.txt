The bowling went fine, but the service for food and drinks was absolutely terrible.  After about 30 minutes from ordering our food, our breakfast plates came out with the exception of 1 person in our group, his food plate took an extra 30 minutes to make.  We all had the same breakfast plate and couldn't understand what was taking so long for the last person in our group to be served his breakfast.  We asked the manager and the server several times where the last breakfast plate is and there response was; ""it's coming out shortly"".  no apology. 

The bowling was ok.  The price for 3 hours of unlimited bowling was a good deal, but again, the service was absolutely terrible and the food was not that great either.  Fast food from McDonald's would have been better, even from the dollar menu."
