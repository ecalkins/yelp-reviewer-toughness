I guess they expect you to play games first because it was almost 45 minutes before our food arrived. I bought 40.00 in game cards and approx 10 games were out of order. 90.00 and some cheap redemption toys later we headed home. It is a very gorgeous building though. Also make sure your kids have socks and shoes and not flip flops on or they are not allowed to do laser tag or laser maze.
