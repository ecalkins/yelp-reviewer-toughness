This is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this store.  When I talk to anyone in the store (most recently an asst. manager) about this there are no apologies.  All 3 times were like this.  
A while ago, I purchased shrimp at Safeway and got it home to find it was spoiled, I returned to the store and the manager replaced double the shrimp and refunded my money.  Now, that's customer service.
Fry's may offer good prices but you can't put a price tag on good customer service."
