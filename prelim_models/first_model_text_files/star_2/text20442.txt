I come here for Happy Hour and on Friday nights. I enjoy the wings. I have to agree with Alex N. I think I also get super powers of invisibility!
The bartender Sarah has a badge that says something about being 'certified' or something or other. I guess you can be certified in something and still suck at it! Sarah has the personality of a tree stump. I honestly have never seen her smile. 
I came on a Friday night and Sarah spent most the night talking to 2 of her girlfriends at the end of the bar. She ignored the other patrons. Even the guy sitting next to me commented on it. There were 3 girls behind the bar and both of us sat with empty glasses. 
It all starts with management. If they don't watch the girls and give helpful criticism, then it never gets better. If they hire poorly...then they get poor quality help. 
I will keep coming only for the wings. I just won't tip well until they figure out how to smile and be nice. Tipping is my silent comment on their poor service.  I hope they are listening!!"
