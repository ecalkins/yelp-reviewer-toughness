The package includes a room for an hour and then attractions for an hour.  The room was nice and big, but you get pushed out pretty quickly so they can set up next party.  The attractions packages are a rip.  I think my son got through one laser tag and had to wait in line at the bumper cars for 30 minutes, because they had to switch out a few bumper cars... The lazer maze was another disappointment... My wife attempted to go through the laser maze with my son... Waited in line told the teenager that she wanted to go in with my son as a duo..Finally got in there and the stinking card expired...Bummer.  Honestly I think you stand in line longer than you actually get in attractions...Also the birthday room girl was tipped twice, which was more of a communication breakdown between my wife and I, but possibly a slight integrity issue on the teenager room attendant.   Overall meh...room is nice, but expect total chaos, maybe you get 1 or 2 attractions for the kids, and that is all you get for $300 plus ( which includes double tip)"
