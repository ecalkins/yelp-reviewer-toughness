The presentation was subpar and our pot of tea went dry without the waiters' attention.  The checkout process is beyond embarrassing.  You have to take your cheque and queue at the register near the front door.  There were two parties in line in front of us and it took over 10 minutes to pay and get out the door.  

Their ha-gap were OK, but we tried 9 other dishes and I would pass.  The price is competitive with Mekong but I think the quality and service at Mekong is far superior."
