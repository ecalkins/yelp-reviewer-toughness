The bartender was older but said she didn't know either. She didn't offer to find out, so we ordered coffee with a Jameson's side.  BWW is know for a very good variety of beer on tap. I tried to get some recommendations but the waitress and bartender were useless on this request too.  The restaurant was not busy by any means, just a few people besides us. It took a half hour to get a small order of wings. The wings were very good and our waitress was polite but she had no support from the bartender and the kitchen was slow. It was a very poor experience.
