We went for my dad's birthday tonight and it was a bit of a disaster. We had a party of 7 with 4 people over the age of 60. We waited an hour and were seated in the back of the patio. It was 99 degrees at that hour and we were seated where there were no misters. We asked if we could be reseated inside or in the main part of the patio. The woman who was the manager told us we'd have to wait for 90 mins for either. She claimed there was a party of 15 that was waiting ahead of us. As it turns out, that was a party of 10 and they showed up an hour after we did. After unnecessary back and forth, they moved the not so powerful portable AC in our direction so we stayed.

The food, as usual, was solid but the service was bad. Our waitress dropped multiple comments throughout our dinner about how other guests under the covered patio with misters were annoyed that the direction of the portable AC changed. She didn't come check on us very much so we had empty water glasses for a lot of the night. 

Overall, the way they dealt with the seating was unprofessional and difficult. This could have been avoided if they had asked us if we were ok with being seated in that part of the patio prior to placing us there. I don't think I'll be back here any time soon."
