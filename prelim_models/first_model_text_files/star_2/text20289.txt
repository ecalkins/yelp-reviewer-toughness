We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  

So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it...."
