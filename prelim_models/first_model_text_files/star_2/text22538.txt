You'll get nothing out of the ordinary with Great Wall Cuisine - a few dim sum carts with your standard fare, an outdated banquet hall, and subpar service.  But even that, I can deal with, because I live in PHX and there's like, two places that serves dim sum.

What I can't get with is charging TWENTY dollars for pea shoots.  Are you kidding me????  But I guess it's my fault for ordering off the menu, right?  My fault for assuming that there's no way they'd charge more than ten bucks for sauteed veggies at an old school Chinese restaurant in a deserted strip mall.  SILLY ME!!

I always knew my people were tricksy.  It was just a matter of time before I fell for one."
