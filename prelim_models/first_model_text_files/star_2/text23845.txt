The definition of Dreck is: something that is of very bad quality : trash or rubbish.

Their Dreck will not make you ill.
It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like.

SpaghettiOsÂ® would of been a welcomed sight, last night.
                          Our Server ........ was wonderful.

I was not surprised, to have dined on Dreck ..... In Fact I was expecting it.
                      Three out of four in my party ...... desired Dreck.

I recommend Olive Garden ...... If you need a DRECK FIX"
