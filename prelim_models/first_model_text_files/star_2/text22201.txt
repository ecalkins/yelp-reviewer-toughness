You end up having to wait for 10+ minutes once you arrive anyway, whether you are early or late. I just don't get it. Last time I came it was 4:00 in the afternoon and there about 5 tables occupied but 8 that hadn't been cleaned or bussed. Seriously what are these employees doing? I don't blame them, management clearly doesn't train very well and doesn't seem to care at all about basic restaurant standards. Overall, it's a shame because I love the food, I would eat there 3-4 times per week if they could just run a DECENT operation. Come on guys, get it together!!!
