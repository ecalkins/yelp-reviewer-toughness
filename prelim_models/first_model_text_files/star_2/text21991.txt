In between each course there was little to no attention given over the course of nearly two and a half hours. The salad given didn't come with the dressing listed and created a bland starter. In addition the sweet potatoes that came with the main course were far too overcooked to the point they were unedible. The lobster that was part of the Valentine's special was far too overcooked and became rubbery and difficult to eat. Our waitress never asked how things were and the restaurant was not busy. Every other table looked upset as well with the overall service. In addition with the special there was desert but the wrong one was brought out. The mango sorbet that was brought on accident tasted overtly sweet and was inedible. I imagine that with the proper staff this could be a decent place to go but I wouldn't recommend it for the experience we had.
