We then moved to the regular seating area after talking to the host, and it took forever for our server to arrive. When we asked questions about the menu, the server didn't seem very polite. We watched the game ""Georgia vs Alabama"" for over 2 hours, and we never got asked if we needed a refill or any extra drinks. Not until I asked for a to-go box I was asked if I needed a drink. The server hardly ever walked around us or the surrounding tables within that 2 hour period. I hadn't visited BWW in over two years, and I feel like now I'll never go back after this experience. Food was good but the place is overrated and has bad service. Avoid this location at all cost."
