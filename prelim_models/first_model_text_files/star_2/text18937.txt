I've given this place enough forgiveness and it is time to pull the plug.  I'm never going there again.  The last time I went there, there was literally 7 people in there, and my food took 25 minutes from the time I ordered for it to-go.  The place has always been slow on delivery.  

There is nothing worse than patronizing a place which is rude and does not appreciate your business.  I've experienced far better customer service and appreciation.  My recommendation to this place is be more friendly and appreciative.  We customers pay your bills.  I hope more people boycott your place.  Maybe that will teach you some manners."
