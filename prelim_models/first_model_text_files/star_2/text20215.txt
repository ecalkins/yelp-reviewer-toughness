My spouse actually drives out of her way to the basic Fry's at Thunderbird and 40th Street just to avoid this Fry's clutter and higher priced selections. Nearby (smaller) Trader Joes and Albertson's are also preferable in our view. We would also rather support local shops and restaurants for our specialty/gourmet food needs.

So what motivated this review? A cake. A stale cake. A stale birthday cake. A stale birthday cake that was cute, but much more expensive than comparable cakes at Costco or Albertson's or Walmart. Yes, Walmart, the discount purveyor of soft and moist cakes, unlike those sold at Fry's. Thank you Fry's for nearly ruining our party. Thankfully our guests were great. Chill. Of course that's why they were invited. Still, the kindest thing said about the cake was, ""It wasn't so bad."" But it was. How can this happen? The cake was picked up an hour before the party. Baked fresh, then frozen, then thawed, then frozen... I suppose. Stand alone, the bakery deserves a negative star rating. No more Fry's baked goods for us. 

FYI, the birthday party was nearly three weeks ago. I hate Yelp reviews written in anger over a single incident, so I waited a bit to write this one. You should have seen the first draft of this review :) The final draft was written, however, with years of experience at this store and its predecessors in mind. Thus, two stars rather than one."
