Anyway, it's too late to get a date, so.. on with the review. Soup - ok. Salad - meh.  $8.95 for both? Overpriced. Watching the carbs, so didn't eat anything that I normally would have. Unfortunately, I checked the nutrition info before we went, so don't know if I ever will again.  It's like pouring some marinara over a salt lick and serving it to me on a plate. Blech.

 Honestly, this place never held the special plate in my heart that it does for some people I know, even when it was one of two Italian restaurants in the small Illinois town I was raised.  But why are you reading this? You've been there already and have your own opinion.  Just don't read the nutritional info before you go."
