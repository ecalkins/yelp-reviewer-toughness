It's as though they take Frozen wings from Walmart and throw them in the oil and then just slap on generic hot sauce. The redeeming value is that the food is cheap which is probably the reason they were probably so many people there. For $14 my husband and I got a dozen hot wings, a cheeseburger with french fries, and an order of onion rings.
