I ordered egg rolls, won ton soup, and the house special chow fun. 

The egg rolls were decent. Nothing bad or exceptional. The won ton soup was a little below average. As noted in someone else's review, the broth is basically chicken stock. Not much depth in flavor. The wontons were a little bit dried out and chewy. I've had much worse, but I've had much better too. 

The big problem was the chow fun. I ordered it wet but I think the noodles were overcooked and soggy. But even worse, the seafood was very overcooked. The pieces of fish, shrimp, and especially scallops were so rubbery. I was not impressed with the freshness of the seafood or the cooking technique. I managed to eat most of it since I was really hungry, but I should have ordered the beef chow fun.  

I don't think I'll go back anytime soon. The Chow Fun at South China Restaurant (now Joe's Diner) on 7th ave blows it away. Even the rather mediocre chow fun at Lucky Dragon on Thomas was better than Super Dragon's version."
