I wont name names (mainly because she didnt give it to us), but the server was entirely unattentive, rude, and couldnt course a meal to save her life. Myself and  five others were seated for dinner on the patio. We waited roughly 15 minutes before our server decided to greet us. we placed our entire order drinks, apps, entree at once, not wanting to wait another 15 minutes to order. well the drinks took 15 minutes to get to the table anyway. Dinner came roughly a half hour later, all at once. No apps first or anything. I myself work in the business and know its really not that hard to course a meal. Anyway i was really disappointed as bad service can ruin a meal, and i was looking forward to this dinner. To be honest the food wasnt even that great. guess ive been having better pizza recently, as ive been sticking to the Family owned restaurants... If you want the combined Ambience,food, and service, try Brugos in Cave Creek, They're great!!
