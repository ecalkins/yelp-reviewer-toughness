The restaurant is small and has a homey atmosphere.  I went around lunch time and it was full.  I ordered my son the kid's meal that comes with chicken fingers and fries.  Unfortunately the chicken fingers were burnt and I had to send them back for edible ones.  The replacement ones were overcooked, dry and had little taste.  The fries were standard.

My wife ordered the Caesar salad that consisted of a mayonnaise based dressing that tasted horrible.  Finally, I had soft shell tacos that were good, not great.  The prices are reasonable, but I have yet to find a reason to return."
