I also want to try their Japanese cheese cake, so I got one too. Before I decided to buy, I even asked the lady if the cheesecake is freshly made or from the previous day, because it's the last one in the case and she said YES. But after I tried it, It was hard, no taste and seem stale. I think it's been sitting there for a week? I don't know how often they make cheese cake. But I'm so disappointed with that. I've had better ones somewhere else. 

I think their fresh birthday cake are good, but please make sure it looks fresh to you and ask before purchase it."
