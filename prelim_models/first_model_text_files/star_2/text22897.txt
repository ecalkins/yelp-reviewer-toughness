Then the kicker is going inside to order because I really like the food, asking what happened and having the 12yr old at the counter give me attitude and act like a total prick.  

I like supporting local restaurants but you need to pick your s*&$ up.  It doesn't matter how good you food is - if I know its going to be a hassle more often than not I'll just go to one of the other 900 burger places in town..."
