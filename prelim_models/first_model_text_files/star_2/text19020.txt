I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and was surprised at what I received. It was not the Vietnamese bun bo hue but another dish that kind of resembled it. I felt as if I was eating pho with a hint of some other spices found in a typical bun bo hue dish. 

The house fish sauce tasted like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle. I was actually pretty impressed with the peanut sauce though. 

I am aware that Phoenix does not offer a variety of Vietnamese restaurants but this place will get the job done."
