On the plate with it was a bed of lettuce that looked a little old (probably due to the sauce they put on top). Also on the menu they stated they had beer and sake but their liquor license was revoked. They couldn't serve it. Finally while eating, they were cleaning tables, which I appreciate, but all I could smell is bleach. Overall I will not be going back to this location.
