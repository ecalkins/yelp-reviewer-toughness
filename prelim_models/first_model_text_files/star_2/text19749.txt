So disappointed in rest of food last night. Food was not fresh and sushi looked liked it was out since their lunch hour. Dried up and not fresh at all!!
Should not have eaten the sushi.. Had bad food poisoning all night.. Not sure I will return to this place for awhile... We've been going here since they opened up years ago... A little too pricey for dried up food."
