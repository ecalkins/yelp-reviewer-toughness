They call that banh mi? If their pho is as off-base as their banh mi, it must be made with linguini. Though the price was right ($4 for a sub and a big steamed bun), everything else was wrong. The bread seemed like it was cut from a cheap grocery store French bread, the veggies weren't properly pickled, and it was just.....boring. The pork was tasty, but I asked for BBQ pork and I'm pretty sure that was lemongrass grilled pork. Finally, the steamed ground pork bun was a little off. Not sure how else to describe it. This can't be Phoenix's best Vietnamese, so keep looking for it, hungry jack."
