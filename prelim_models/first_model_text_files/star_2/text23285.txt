Understaffed, so you can spend 20 minutes waiting in line while the overworked person who takes orders and delivers orders and runs extra napkins to the customers tries to do it all. Don't come in here expecting a quick meal. Expect to stand in line. You've got to wonder if the owners have set foot in the place in the last few years.
