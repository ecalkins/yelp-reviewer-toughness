It was busy the entire time we were there. Many of the patrons were Asian which in my opinion is always a very good sign when dinning in an oriental restaurant. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I think we had 5 different people serving us. 

I went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise. Some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp. One of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here. So I had to try it out. Well it was ok, the walnuts were odd almost praline. The shrimp seemed on the verge of being undercooked and a couple of the shrimp were not cleaned well. That just stopped me in my tracks and I couldn't finish. I guess I have been spoiled by my beloved Gina (Big Wong) her walnut shrimp with mayonnaise was incredible! 

We also tried the fried rice and was not impressed here either it was very bland no flavor at all. They served a mountain of it but it just didn't have any taste to it. The egg rolls were crisp yet greasy, they were small and the inside was mush almost liquefied. My friend experienced the same problem with her dish under seasoned. 

It was a little like dinning in an Asian old folk's home; you know no salt everything bland, edible just not appetizing. : ) I really wanted to like this place. I will not be back."
