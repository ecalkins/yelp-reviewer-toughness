Screens everywhere but the music was so loud we couldn't talk across the table. Finally ordered drinks and some food. A friend ordered boneless wings buffalo style hot. They came out breaded with this dry powder on them like Cheeto dust. They were awful. My other friend had about 5 mixed drinks and he said it felt like 1. Would not go back. Went to the one in Flagstaff and it was fine.
