this one was just not up to their brand standards, though. you can see on other reviews some of the issues i will mention here.

staff wasn't very friendly upon arrival. i ordered a hot beverage in the middle of a hot summer day. yes, i know what i ordered. why are you questioning me? O_o also, if you're going to ask my name, and then ask me to spell it to you, please try to listen. no point in having me spell it to you for you to get something completely different! #unusualnameproblems  it took about 10 minutes for my drink to be made. the guy that took my order just rang me up and walked away leaving the drive-thru barista to hop over to the other bar to make my drink. she didn't seem too pleased. sad thing was this translated into grumpy customer service.

i sat down in the room with all the tables and notices that there wasn't really any air flow. it was at least 104 degrees outside, but inside wasn't cool and refreshing like you expect starbucks to be. 

after sitting a while more, i began to notice how quiet it was in this area with all the tables. i could hear all the baristas bantering back and forth but there was no music!! music adds to the ambiance that IS starbucks. 

it was just a weird experience all together. thank god there are tons of them around so next time i can just pick an entirely different store to visit."
