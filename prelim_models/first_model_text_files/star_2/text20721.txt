We have been there several times and had great food but, we went last night, after having not been there for over a year and it seems to have gone downhill a bit.  The burger had this burnt taste and not the good char flavor but that bad burnt flavor you can't get out of your mouth.  The fries were so over-seasoned it was like I stuck my tongue in the season mix.  I was there with my husband and son and none of us could eat them.  My son, who usually inhales burgers, left a quarter of his and said he didn't like it. The tables were sticky, the floor was dirty and the paint needs a refresher.  It's old enough that it needs a facelift (especially the nasty ceiling tiles...maybe take those out and go for the more modern loft look with the ceiling open and painted black). Hope the owners can take a step back, take a look around, clean the place up and go back to the basics of good food.
