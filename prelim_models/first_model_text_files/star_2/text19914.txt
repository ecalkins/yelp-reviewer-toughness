The restaurant is an old Claimjumper location with uncomfortable chairs. The sushi selection they had was pretty good and much better than the usual options at a Chinese buffet. There was sashimi, nigiri, and plenty of specialty rolls to choose from. Besides from the sushi, they only had about two rows of hot food to choose from. Pretty much the usual Chinese dishes that are offered at buffets. They also had crab legs and oysters (which my friend said was pretty good). So overall the food was OK, I was just expecting more for what I paid. I probably will not come back, I'll save my money for when I go to Vegas and want a real buffet.
