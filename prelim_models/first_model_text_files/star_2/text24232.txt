I've gone to this restaurant to eat as well in the recent past and felt the service was crappy and the food was mediocre. Think I'm done giving this establishment my money.. Recommend you find a different, less crowded, less loud and less over priced Italian restaurant. Unless you like not being able to hear each other talk and having crappy services plus a high bill, by all means.
