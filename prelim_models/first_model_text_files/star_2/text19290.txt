The music was very loud disco with black lights flashing everywhere. It was really dark in there and while their balls glow in the dark we brought our own so it was hard to see where it was going. There's huge tv screens at the end of the lanes that play some music videos but A LOT of commercials...oh then tennis came on for a bit. It was really distracting and I didn't appreciate all the ads. It was truly sensory overload which I totally blame on my low scores!  Plus an employee had to keep going down to the end of the lanes by way of a walkway and since we had an end lane it was annoying. He didn't time his walk bys very well and he'd walk by right when someone was throwing the ball. Don't they teach bowling etiquette?!  I doubt we'll be back.
