Even just looking for it, it was hard to believe that a place rated so high on Yelp would be in such a crappy area and mall! The inside just seems dirty, the windows are hard to see out of, it looks like nothing has been moved around in years. If the food knocks you out, you get over that grime and dust, but the food here was just medocre.  Nothing great, nothing bad, just ok. We had pho, bbq pork, spring rolls, egg rolls and noodles.  Charge me more, clean the place, and maybe I'd come back and give it another shot!"
