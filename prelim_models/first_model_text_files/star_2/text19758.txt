The sushi rice was dry and the neta (fish part) was thin enough to try out for a Paris runway. The sashimi was also very thin, although it was freshly prepared. They had lobster and crab but truth is I didn't get to  eat much of it since they didn't have any utensils available. The best stuff was the tempura and the egg rolls. It definitely wasn't worth the amount we paid. Plus my wife was throwing up all night when we got home. Not sure if there was a connection but it was not the best way for our anniversary to end.
