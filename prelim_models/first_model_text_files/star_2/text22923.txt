We haven't had issues with cross contamination in the past, but every time we go there and a certain girl is taking our order, she messes it up every single time. We do not have out of the ordinary orders- we just get them without buns. Once we ordered all lettuce wrapped and we were brought out gluten buns, we were missing a fry order on another occasion and were never given it after asking about it, and on the latest stop I got very sick after going which means I was cross contaminated somehow. The burgers are delicious 4/5 star worthy and fries are 5/5 but I don't think we will ever be coming here again because of too many issues with food safety as celiacs.
