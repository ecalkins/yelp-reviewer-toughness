The food quality is average and below but they charge you like a buffet in Vegas.  

The Sushi are pre-made and setting on the tray, not fresh made per order.  Very limited choice.  The sashimi are thinly slice and taste not fresh too.  When ask for a sashimi, the guy give you a pile of sashimi and put them on your plate, no presentation or anything..(there you go...eat it!!)  

The Oysters, some fresh some not.  Few of those are sitting on the ice under the light for a long time, I have some of those and they are warm, not fresh!

Salad and fruit bar, I believe the pineapple from the can, and the oranges are from one of the backyard, so sour.    

The soup choice are Hot and Sour soup, Egg drop soup and miso soup...very basic and you could find them in any Chinese buffet for $5.99 AYCE.  $21.99, I expect better quality of soup.  Hot and Sour soup, not hot not sour.  Very disappointed.  

The clams, almost every each one of them have sands in it.  After a couple of those clams, I don't even want to try it. 

The mongolian grill (the noodle, cook per order).  The food choice are very limited.

The BBQ ribs, too dry!

The other food are average, you could find it in any Chinese buffet for half price or under $10 bucks! 

This restaurant 1-2 stars the most.  I won't recommend other to try this place, even with a coupon...don't waste your money.  

I would recommend go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet, same buffet style, food are better, more choices, taste better, fresh sushi (made per order), and lower price ($15.99), I vote that for 4 stars at least."
