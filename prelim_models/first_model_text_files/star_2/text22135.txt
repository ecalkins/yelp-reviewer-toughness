If it's cooked to order I'm shocked by how little flavor it has.  Also I'm confused by this location.  I ordered a chorizo torta because the Filiberto's website says it contains chorizo, eggs, guacamole, lettuce & mayo.  Yet mine contained chorizo egg beans and cheese.  Do each of these places have their own menus?
