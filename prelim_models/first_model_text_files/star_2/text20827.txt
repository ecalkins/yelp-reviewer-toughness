I was so excited to visit this restaurant since it's only 5 minutes from my house and I've heard nothing but great things from everyone I know about this place, but I didn't have that experience. 

The restaurant itself has a terrible aesthetic. I came in thinking it's because they focus on their food over the location and d√©cor and I'd prefer it that way, but since I didn't like the food it just added to my dislike. I ordered the Burger Brulee which sounded great, but I don't like yolk dripping everywhere because it is so messy and I end up having to wash my face after eating a burger with it so I asked if they could scramble the eggs. They couldn't so I asked them to over cook the egg. They said they couldn't do that either... I don't feel like arguing about it with them, I'm already here, the burger sounds good, and I'm not wear makeup so I decide that I'll just wash my face in the bathroom when I finish and I completed my order with the french toast fries. 

When I got my food, the fries were cold and the burger wasn't straight. Meaning the burger was all over the place and it looked like someone threw the ingredients in the basket in order, but from a couple feet away with no regard for presentation of the food or the mess it was going to make. After I put my burger together and made a mess of myself the food was ok, but it felt like I was eating leftovers that just aren't as good as they were the day before when the meal was fresh.

I'm so disappointed in this place. It had all the right options on the menu and it had the credibility not only on social media, but also from my friends and colleagues so I was terribly let down when I didn't get to have the experience I was told I would."
