Our lane wasn't working the whole time, when the pins were set there would be pins missing. Had to reset about 10-15 times within our 2 and half games before we left. Even went to the front desk to tell them and also mention how gross the restrooms were. They responded with, ""oh those aren't suppose to be used."" Confused as to why they are unlocked and accessible to that room if they aren't supposed to be. Attached are some pictures of the condition of these restrooms. Service wasn't the best, when they want you to leave they make it know.  Our entire lane shut off and had to have them turn it back on, while vacuuming and staring at up while we played. Wouldn't recommend this place, unless you don't care about being the person that doesn't mind walking up to the desk 10x."
