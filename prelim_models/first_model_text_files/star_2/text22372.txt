Well, I didn't realize that they only do dim sum BEFORE 2:30 (every day). That was a fail on my part. We decided to stay since we were already there and starving. We ordered the egg rolls, wonton soup, kung pao chicken and bbq pork chow mein (all pretty standard dishes). My two star rating is based on the fact that their dishes lacked flavor! The kung pao was so bland and didn't pack any heat at all! And I'm not one who enjoys eye watering, mouth burning heat but I at least expected there to be a bit of a kick. The chow mein was greasy and the bbq pork was dry. The only thing that I actually enjoyed was the wonton soup. I wish I had ordered more of that!

Most everyone mentioned the lack in customer service and honestly, that usually doesn't bother me. But when I have to get my own take out box or my own water because no one cares to check up on us, that's when it gets a bit annoying.

I may go back and check out their dim sum but I'll be sure to bring my own drinks and Tupperware with me next time."
