Flavor, that's the problem.  There was NO flavor.  I could tell they were using good quality meat based on the texture, but it was the most bland burger I've ever had in my life.

I thought, ""Maybe it's just my burger.  Every place can mess one up."" so I tried my wife's burger.  Nope.  Bland. Flavorless.  Missing any manner of savoriness.  

She gave up about halfway through hers, so I picked her burger up, removed the bun and toppings, and just tasted the beef by itself.  Yup...great texture, not an ounce of flavor.  So I picked up another chunk, grabbed the salt shaker and poured literally 4 grains of salt on the chunk of meat.  Not a bunch, only four goddamned crystals.  

Holy shit, I could suddenly taste the beef!  There was flavor!  It was buttery and rich!  What the fuck?  Did they skip salt?  I don't want a salty burger or anything but crap, use SOME.

We agreed there was literally nothing there that would make that burger win over a damn In N Out Burger.  I don't understand all these accolades...you can use the best ingredients in the world but if you refuse to give it flavor, there's no point."
