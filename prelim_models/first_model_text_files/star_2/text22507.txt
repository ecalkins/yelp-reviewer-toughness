The only thing we get now is the BBQ bun and even that one is fading. Maybe just our taste buds but pls try it out. They really had us for more than 4 yrs. Might need to stay away for awhile and then come back after few months. 

:) still like there dimsum. A bit pricey but its the only dim sum I know near phx area.

Update: the flavor is degrading a bit. Their usual spicy pork chop just got erased from our to go. It's so salty now. 

Also this came to my mind the pink slip. I think it would be nice if they put a English version of that paper that they come and check every time you order something. Wouldn't that be nice?"
