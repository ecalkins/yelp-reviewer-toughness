I don't do the half caf, part skim, part whole, chai, with light chocolate sprinkles venti grande tallie or whatever. I truly  hate those people. But I did request a soy latte. They were out of soy. Hmmm...Ok. I run a restaurant, I understand running out of products. Next day, same StarYucks. Same drive thru. Same monster in the window. Soy Latte please. Sorry, no soy milk. Oh for crap sake. This StarYucks is 200 yards from a grocery store. That sells soy and other market goods. So I peeled out, went to Lux, and my world was at peace. Once again.
