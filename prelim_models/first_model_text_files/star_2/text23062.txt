Waited 10 minutes without any acknowledgement. Saw the car around the corner move forward still no acknowledgement. Yelled at speaker, no reply. Waited a minute more and pulled forward assuming speaker was dead. As I am pulling away I hear someone welcoming me to the Stand and asking me to please wait. The young lady running the drive through 2/19/2018 @ 6:40PM needs to be trained or let go because when a vehicle pulls up it should be immediately acknowledged (especially since there drive through is not properly designed to support being close to the speaker). I went inside to place my order and there was 1 person in the place. The internal staff were proficient and the food did not take long to cook. The food is good here but the prices they charge are close to what I pay at other sit down burger franchises on Camelback.  The Stand was my go to place for convenience since it was a quality burger with a drive through. If they can't fix the drive through they should shut it down completely.
