The fries were soggy and tiny, like they collected all the little scraps of fries from the bottom of the bag, cooked them until they were just limp enough, then tossed them in our bag.  Stand Sauce?  What is that?

The Stand burger was just okay.  Honestly, for the price, InAndOut is far superior in both burger and fries.

I know.  The Stand in Arcadia once stood tall, and business was booming.  So much so they opened another location in Scottsdale.  I guess that is where all the attention goes now.

Buh-bye, The Stand.  It was nice while you lasted."
