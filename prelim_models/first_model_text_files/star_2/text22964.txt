As others have noted, it's a very limited menu here, and I went the cheeseburger route tonight. This is an order at the counter place, and then your food is brought out in a few minutes. My cheeseburger was 2 patties of beef cooked to death, not burned but so well-done that the beef was completely dried out, little flavor. Cheese was taste-free. Three thick rings of white onion, two dill pickle chips, a lot of lettuce, and ""Stand sauce"", whatever that is. The white bread bun was as dry as the burger, so no improvement there; its surface cracked while I was eating it. It might have been grilled? French fries were the frozen variety, mostly pieces around an inch long or shorter, varied between crispy (the small bits) and not crispy (the fewer longer pieces). Another reviewer stated that fries were free on Mondays? Not true for me. Full price. Stand sauce"" costs extra. There's better news with the shake:  Deep chocolate flavor, thick, creamy, and a big wide boba straw so you can actually drink it, and the only thing that brought this review up to two stars. There's also Coke hecho en Mexico in 500 mL glass bottles. 
Sorry to have to be so negative, but I'm lost as to all these 4-5 star ratings, just don't see or taste it here. I love cheeseburgers, I do, but I couldn't even finish this one. Shocking. I'd have returned it for a do-over, but my dining partner's sandwich was exactly the same as mine, so I don't think it was a fluke. I'll come back to try some of the tacos, and the ""Mexican corn"" sounds good (seasonal spring-summer), but for burgers I'll be dining elsewhere. Life's too short for a bad cheeseburger."
