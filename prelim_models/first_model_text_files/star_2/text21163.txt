I have had the pulled pork and it was just Meh for me, I had the sloppy joe and it was awful. I told the owner it was awful and he was a stand-up guy and gracious enough to replace it with the pulled pork.  Thinking recently that I was missing the boat, I ordered a Cheeseburger with fries and a soda for $9.24. There are no refills on sodas. This is probably designed to keep the nearby high school kids from loitering all afternoon after school. The burger tasted like it was cooked in the morning and reheated. It had a char taste to it but quite frankly I have had better burgers at Burger King. The fries were way over seasoned and did not taste good and were thrown away.

So I feel like I can go to Whataburger down the street and get a much better tasting burger, fries and free refills for a lesser price."
