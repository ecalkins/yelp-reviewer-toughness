The flavors would work great if the meat was flavorful. The patty definitely seem like it had been frozen no flavor at all so took a lot of flavor from the rest of the burger. The sauces to dip weren't that great. 

The lemonade was good! And the place looked cute. 

But if the food isn't good then what's the point? Sorry wouldn't even recommend the plac"
