First she asks my mom if she wants to try out one of the sangrias and when my mom says she will think about it, she instantly replies saying she will bring one out. 

After our meal she asked if anyone wanted dessert and I said I wanted to try the mini $2.99 lemon dessert. She brought out something totally different so I politely say I wanted the small lemon dessert, again she brings out a large slice of lemon cake. I didn't even bother asking her to replace it since I felt like she was purposely trying to leave me with a higher dollar item. 

When we got the tab I noticed she rang in a higher priced dessert than what I ended up with so I asked if she could correct it, she says they are the same price. I point out that the dessert I got was actually cheaper, she then checked and says oh you're right.. I work in sales so I understand upselling but I'm not a fan of being purposely overcharged."
