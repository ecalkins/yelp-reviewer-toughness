It took them 25 minutes to check on us after we were seated and ask for our order.  Literally 25 because my son watched a whole episode of umizoomi and started another. Its not like they were packed or busy.  The miso soup tasted watered down.  The sushi was ok tasting. I feel like i wasted my money going there. Don't plan on coming back.
