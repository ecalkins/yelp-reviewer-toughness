Sauce was good but not a fan of 'leaf' lettuce on a burger....shredded Iceberg to me is the best way to go.  did not try the frys but was intrigued by the tacos so I tried their  short rib taco, its was nice  different  salsa was good and fresh.....if I went again  it would only be for the tacos, 'if' I went  Im on the other side of the valley doubtful it would be worth a second trip.
