The chicken was clearly a frozen slab with little seasonings and a small portion of pasta. I had about a bite before deciding to box it up for my husband to take to work the next day, it wasn't even worth eating. I had a bite of a friend's lasagna which was tasty. Another friend had a dish that had a ""side of orzo"".  In reality, it was a few leaves of lettuce with some orzo sprinkled in. When you advertise it as ""orzo"", you need to deliver the product. Service was okay, although it didn't really seem like the servers knew who was responsible for what, as people came and went but no one in particular was really dedicated to our party."
