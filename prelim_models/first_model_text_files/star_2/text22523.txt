I have been to C-Fu, China King, MeKong Palace, and Phoenix Palace.  Unfortunately, this is my least favorite place.  The Dim Sum is not fresh (except the dumplings in the tin covers, and these were mediocre at best), and a lot of it was greasy (deep fried).  What a pity considering all the rave reviews on this site.  The eggplant with the shrimp on top was old.   We tried the deep fried soft shell crab, and this was greasy and salty, the deep fried egg rolls with shrimp; again greasy and cold.  Even the Chinese broccoli was old and over sauced.  There was one shinning dish:  the tripe was delicious.

Overall, much better food quality at other places.  I hated to say this as I really wanted to like this place, but it is what it is...very mediocre"
