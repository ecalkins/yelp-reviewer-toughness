However the soup's broth was basically plain chicken stock, and needed soy sauce and pepper to make it tasty.  The fried rice had a good amount of seasoning and meat, but it was extremely greasy/oily.  I've never had fried rice with this much oil!  A copious amount coated the interior of the white takeout container as I moved the rice into a plastic storage container.

The pricier version of the soup, the wor wonton, is even less desirable...bland, overcooked veggies and meat, sadly."
