I said I'm not trying to substitute just asking you not to throw the children in. Anyways after we got home with the food there was no silverware in with the food.( good thing we were eating at home). Anyways the noodles had a burnt oil taste which made me sick later and the fried rice was mediocre. I've been to better places and treated better for less money. I think I will pass next time. I could have went to panda express and been happier. They don't burn noodles.
