Drove up and the place looked completely run-down from the outside.  No problems, I'm cool with that, I've certainly climbed into my fair share of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants in San Francisco and Hong Kong.  The places that look like their housing criminals but you can't help but forgive it because the food is oh-so-good.  

Too bad Da Vang wasn't like that.  The table wasn't cleaned properly and there were what looked like dried hoi sin sauce on the table.  I had to go through 3 spoons before I found one that didn't have dried food particles clinging to it and then another 5 to find a clean one for my girlfriend.  That is just completely wrong.  Utensils should be clean-not having the last guy's lunch still clinging to it!

I was really hoping the food was good.  I told myself if the food was good I can live with it.  The portion was freaking huge on the XL special pho bowl but half way through the meal I realized it was mostly noodles.  The meat was less than most places and the broth was only so-so in taste. 

Hole in the walls are usually the best kept secrets, unfortunately Da Vang didn't have the cleanliness or the taste to keep me coming back."
