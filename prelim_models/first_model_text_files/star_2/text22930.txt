To my utter dismay and disappointment have recently learned that everything I planned on eating tonight were gone!!! All the tacos and corn, chips and salsa... gone from this location! Why?! Now I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and Shea to enjoy those delicious tacos. After so many years of patronage this is how we're thanked... 

The burgers are good but the likelihood I'll be back is very slim."
