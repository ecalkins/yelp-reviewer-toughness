I went to the drive thru this morning at 5:15 AM.  I ordered 2 dozen donuts.  After that order I asked to order a another dozen but on a separate order.  I was told that I could only do one order at the drive thru.  I went to the window to pick my order up and asked if she could put in my 2nd order.  I was told no and that I had to drive back through.  There was no one else behind me at the drive thru.  I shared that and asked if I really had to drive back around and was told yes, that is the policy.  I should have driven out but I really needed by 2nd order so I drove around, back to the drive thru and ordered my additional dozen.  Again, I do get that you need policies and when there is a line, I do get why you would have this policy but the team members need to be able to make good business decisions in situations like this.
