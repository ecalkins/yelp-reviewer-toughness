Ordered the buger, fries and a short rib taco.

Fries were good.

Burger, not so much.  Bun was really stale...like days, if not weeks, old.  Little flavor to the burger.

Taco was ok, but very salty...and I like salt.

Not the most organized place.  Employees were friendly, but seemed to be running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  Only about 6 people ahead of us and it still took nearly 10 minutes to order.  What's worse is that the menu doesn't really contain many more items that what I ordered so I'm not sure why they can't take orders quickly."
