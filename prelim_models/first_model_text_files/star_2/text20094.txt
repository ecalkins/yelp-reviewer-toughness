I have had some rude run ins with the butcher department before and for some reason (probably because the store IS so big) I keep going back.  I think I am done now though.  I was looking to make a pre-order to pick up on Christmas Eve.  The unsmiling employee who seemed to be an assistant hesitated and then asked the main butcher ""Are we still doing pre-orders?"" He didn't even look up just barked ""NO MORE PRE-ORDERS!""  Now I know why she wasn't smiling.  If I had to work with that guy I would be sad too.  It has never been out of the norm at any grocery I ever went to in the past to get a pre-order for meat in 4 days before an event.  And, in fact, I called 2 other places and it was not a problem at all to get orders in so I have no clue what this guy's problem is but I do know I won't be having to deal with him in the future.  Bye bye Fry's on Shea and Tatum"
