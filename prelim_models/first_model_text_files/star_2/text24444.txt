Very, very little chicken (and I really looked for it -- a small piece here or there).  Not even tasting it at all.  It was also a pretty small portion for the price.  The most egregious problem of all was that the pasta was chewy.(!)   I actually had to take a piece out of my mouth and lay it aside, it was so hard to chew.  The whole bottom layer of the lasagna was inedible - could not cut it with my fork even!  That's pretty bad for a pasta place.

On the plus side, the people who work there are great - very friendly and responsive (only reason I didn't rate it a one star).  If I do go back, I will be certain to avoid the lasagna, but I seriously doubt I will go back.  I will go back to Olive Garden - their lasagna isn't 'chewy'."
