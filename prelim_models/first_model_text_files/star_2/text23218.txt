The cheeseburger was average, nothing that really makes it stand apart from anywhere else with a drive thru. Especially not for 7$. And the tacos! :( I mean they were good but at 2-3 bites not worth 3$. They were just so small. I wish I liked this place because the concept of burgers and tacos is great for indecisive people like me. However, with a small, pricey menu and average taste I don't think I'll be back.
