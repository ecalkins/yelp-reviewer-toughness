The wine/booze section attached is nice. The lanes are spacious. But there really isn't a big selection of ""higher end"" (Not AJ's/Whole Foods level, but that I'm used to getting at Fry's)/organic/etc. products anywhere. The ""bulk section"" is laaaaaughable.

From now on, I'm going completely out of my way to shop at other grocery stores. I would send myself into the poor house doing my regular grocery shopping here, and for not that great product.
