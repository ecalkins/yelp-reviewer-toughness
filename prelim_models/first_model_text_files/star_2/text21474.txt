The hole-in-the-wall burger place did not live up to our expectations. When we got there we grabbed a menu to look it over. Apparently the place was on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They had two burgers that were featured on the show: country fried burger ($7.75) and the booze burger ($9), so we tried those and some fries($2.50). They don't carry fountain drinks either, only cans-so no refills. We ordered to-go and when we got home we were not impressed. The burgers were very small for the prices and the flavor wasn't so great either. The fries also had way too much seasoning for our liking. I don't think we will be returning.
