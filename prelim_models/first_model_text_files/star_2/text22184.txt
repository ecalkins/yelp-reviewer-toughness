I waited outside the restroom (I checked the stalls in the main bathroom. Most of which were empty. After waiting to change my baby's diaper a single girl came out of the family bathroom. Clearly not a family or anyone with a baby. Just some intoxicated girl. The hostesses who are all located by the restrooms didn't even notice they were all too busy gossiping with each other. Worst buffalo wild wings I've ever been to. The food was sub part and the drinks were weak. My water was constantly empty. Choose a diff buffalo wild wings they have so many other locations that are better.
