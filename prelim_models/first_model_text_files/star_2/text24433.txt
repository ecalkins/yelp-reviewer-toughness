It is an extra $.99 and is so bland. There was hardly enough sauce  to cover the pasta so requested a little extra which caused another $.99. Unfortunately it's still did not help the taste. We enjoy background music when eating however the music is so loud that the people in the patio, where we were sitting, we're all shouting to be heard over the music. It was so noisy that I couldn't wait to leave. Lastly the garlic bread was cold and tasteless also. Large portions don't necessarily mean good food. Lastly the service was just mediocre. The waitress was too busy visiting with coworkers to be attentive.
