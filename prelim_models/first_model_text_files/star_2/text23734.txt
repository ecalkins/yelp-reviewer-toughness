Then buy a comal if you don't know what that is google it, it's for heating tortillas rub a little oil on the first tortilla to give it a better texture.  Meats good salsa is good too. The staff was very nice and seemed very interested in what the guest thought. Hope you take this in a positive light, but when having such a small menu everything has got to be good.  Good luck will try again in the future
