The burgers were good all things considered, but overpriced. Same burger is less expensive (by a lot) at The Habit. 
The fries were awful - barley warm, I got the impression they were left over - definitely not a fresh batch. If they would have been fresh, they may have been good.
We also ordered two shakes- one chocolate, one vanilla. Again, the shakes were good - nothing incredibly special, but good yet overpriced.
Can't say we will return as there are too many equally as good burger joints that are not so expensive."
