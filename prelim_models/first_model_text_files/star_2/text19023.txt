That was the last time I decided to go back. I've also seen the older workers cutting their toe nails in there. It is pretty dirty and there is other pho places for about the same price that look cleaner than this place. Don't get me wrong the food was good, and the prices are pretty low but the customer service and the lack of cleanliness keep me from coming back.
