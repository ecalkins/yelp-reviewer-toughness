Then to add insult to injury, the portion was half the size as usual. I sent my food back and said I no longer wanted it. No apology or anything.  I'm used to my food coming out a couple minutes later because of what I order,  but for my dinner companion to be finished before I'm served is ridiculous.  Additionally,  there were no vegetables served with my dish. Just crazy bad today.
