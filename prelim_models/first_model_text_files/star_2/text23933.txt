Items I would not recommend:
- Eggplant Parmesan (oily and you can tell it used to be frozen)
- Shrimp Primavera (undercooked shrimp and chewy pasta)

Salad's actually pretty tasty, and the middle of the breadsticks good (but ends are hard).

Considering that they charge you $14-18 per entree and the place was crowded at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, they must be raking in the dough, which is pretty sad.  Next time you're craving Italian, try a delicious locally owned establishment with some character, like Michelina's - I know I will!"
