No they were not busy and when I got there 30 minutes later I still had to wait ten minutes to get my to go order. Not to mention I was watching whoever was preparing my food and he was talking on his cell phone while he was doing it. Whoever was behind the front desk was rude and very unprofessional. I'm disappointed this time.
