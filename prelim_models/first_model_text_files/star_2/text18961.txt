The food was a-ok. An Asian crepe was decent but with a puddle of grease on the plate bottom. Seafood pho was nothing I'd expect..and the broth was red which I never seen before. The pho garnish plate was serving lettuce instead of Thai basil.

Not too bad but nope, I'd not recommend, neither would come back"
