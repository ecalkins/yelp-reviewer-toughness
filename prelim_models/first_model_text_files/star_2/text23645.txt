Added Caramelized onions (actually sweated onions) then roasted jalape√±o peppers (just canned peppers). The burger was 2 out of 5 stars! Then we go to the the Short Rib Taco's!!! Wow what a disappointment!!!!!!!! The marinade was extremely odd to me! Tasted cinnamon and nutmeg in the meat which totally was not appetizing to me. The corn tortilla was cold and flavorless. Pickled onions weren't pickled long enough at all. Then we have the salsa!!!! Two different salsa's they gave us. First One blended and was lacking flavor all together. Second one.... Well it was chunky and in my opinion it was bottled! Tasted like Pace Picante to me! Absolutely a disappointment!!!! We will never go back! Service was good though!
