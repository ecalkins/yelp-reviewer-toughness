For some reason at this location, my chai tea tastes DISGUSTING almost ALL the time. It has a ""tangy/plastic"" taste to it. Ummmmm? That's not how I would normally describe chai tea. Is it a bad batch? Bad milk? I really don't know what the explanation would be?? 

I only go to this location if I'm in the area, but now after many, many failed attempts at a normal chai tea I will never come back. I've already wasted probably over $100 of chai tea's from this location that I've had to throw out.

I've also changed it up a bit recently (since your chai tea's suck) and ordered a drink with coconut milk and I've never seen so much ice in a cup in my life. No wonder you're getting sued. Ta ta!!!!

P.S. The location on Bethany Home is the busier location for a reason....."
