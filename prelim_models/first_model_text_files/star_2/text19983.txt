if buffet is your thing, this is a great value. such an assortment of dishes!

TIP: loiter at the line and wait until they bring out fresh food then swoop like a vulture. otherwise, you'll have difficulty swallowing.

* korean style rib. good flavor
* hot and sour soup.
* choose your own stir fry. Just make sure the ingredients are fresh

# rancid oysters, clams. argh. what was i thinking
# old sushi. ugh. i'd forgotten what sushi tastes like when it's not made seconds before you eat it
# most nigiri and sashimi is rancid.
# skewered meat. don't know what kind of meat that was, but it was off.


i cut my teeth on buffet. when I was 3 and 4 years old my dad took me to buffet every day for lunch. whoa the memories!

more memories... they still have the ceiling fans connected by belts and pulleys from the bobby mcgee's days."
