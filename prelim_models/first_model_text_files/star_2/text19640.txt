Needless to say the best thing about this place is the name (and I guess prices--but remember you get what you pay for!). The wings made me sick, were super greasy, and the hot sauce was just ok. Their fries were super crispy, way too salty, and the food didn't come out at the same time for the whole table. The seats looked and felt disgusting, and I was really disappointed! I wanted to like the place, but I won't ever be going back.
