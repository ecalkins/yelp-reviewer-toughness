On this dinner visit we walked in and were promptly seated. Our waitress greeted us after a couple of minutes and was super friendly. We already knew what we wanted to order and she advised me the o'zone takes about 20 minutes. I was cool with that so we proceeded with our order. Then it all kind of went downhill. We waited much much longer than 20 minutes. Tables came and left in the time it took for us to receive our meal and pay quickly after. 

Our waitress was doing the best she could. She was constantly running from table to table and did check in on us, thanking us for our patience. She was clearly texting her best but it was a pretty steady night. The thing is, every time I've been dragged in here it's been the same situation. 

The reason this review goes to a two.. the food. It's not even that good. I'm sorry, I've tried to like it, I really have, but it's all pretty blah and never sits well with me either. With many other chain Italian restaurants around, this place just doesn't stand out."
