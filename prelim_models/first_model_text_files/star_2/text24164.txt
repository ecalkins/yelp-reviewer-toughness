Ordered a pacific codd sandwich and an order of cheese curds. Cheese curds were cold and I only got half a sandwich. Bottom bun, shredded lettuce and luckily fish. No tarter sauce, olives or the rest of the condiments, even the top of the bun was missing.

The only reason they are getting two stars instead of one is that my boyfriend liked his hamburger.

 Ordered a pint of chocolate custard, it's probably vanilla."
