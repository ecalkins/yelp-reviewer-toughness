Unfortunately our waiter was horrible. One of our party arrived first, waited 10 min before approached! Beverages took forever, a beer was ordered 10 min later it arrived. Had to ask for bread. Waited 10-15 min to give dinner order. Had to ask for beverage refills. Gave the order he wrote it down.... Then we added a salad, which he did not write down....you guessed it, salad never came. The good thing was we weren't charged for it. 
Thank goodness the meal was comped.... I would have been totally pissed if I had to pay the $100.25 bill with the waiter we had. 
When your in an upscale restaurant you should NEVER have to ask for anything. (Period) no excuses.
Good food, bad waiter. Would give 2.5 if possible for the food only.
Take a chance... Eat in the bar area, dinner specials inn bar not available in dining room. My family usually eats in the bar and they say the waitstaff is great in the bar."
