I came in and there were a couple of people in the restaurant. I was able to immediately place my order, and the girl working the counter was super nice and efficient. As I was waiting for my food, I saw this girl single handedly take orders, deliver food to tables and handle any questions or concerns that were thrown her way like a pro. As I waited and waited, more people came streaming in to order and as a result, began to wait too. You could see some people were starting to get agitated because it was taking awhile. Again, not this poor girls fault. I know lunch hours can be busy, but she was the only person working the front and she had to go into the back to check on items several times while I was there waiting. Just doesn't seem efficient for your busiest time. 

Once I finally got my food, it was okay. I got the large chicken bowl with white meat (Extra $ of course) but I just didn't think it was worth it, especially for just chicken and rice. Maybe teriyaki isn't my thing, but sadly it was pretty unmemorable."
