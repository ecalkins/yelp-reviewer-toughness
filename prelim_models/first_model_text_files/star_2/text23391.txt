As we were waiting 2 other cars that were in line behind us got tired of waiting and drove off. When we got to the drive thru window we asked the girl how often people get tired of waiting and drive off. She said it's only ever happened like 3 times. Hard to believe. We finally got the Carmel Ducle de Leche milkshake. It was phenomenal but I can't help but wonder how much business they lose because of how long their drive thru takes!
