I explained food  cold and with a pleasant attitude the barkeeper took it away.....forever.  At one point he snapped""we have to re cook the whole order"".  The mgr walked by several times and didn't say a word.  Finally after my companion finished his meal and I went back to the left over salad....I asked for my dinner to go. I was told the manager had taken care of it.  CONCEPT:  two people go out to eat, not good for one to sit while guest eats. kitchen, bartender punish you for not being happy with food.  Complimentary meal...not so much...shitty attitude..no repeat business...not in business plan. Have been to other locations and never an issue. Bad management"
