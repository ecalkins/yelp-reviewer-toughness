The rest of the time they try to pass off very thinly sliced meat as shaved. The few times I have pointed this out or asked to have it redone, the deli employees have never been apologetic. Also, I would advise anyone shopping in this Fry's to be very careful about checking expiration dates on cold items. Overall, the store is nice, but many of the employees could use some extra training in customer service - the only exception to this would be the employees of the bakery - I've never had a bad experience with the bakery.
