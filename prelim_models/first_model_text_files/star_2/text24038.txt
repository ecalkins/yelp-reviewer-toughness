Chinese bakeries hold a special place in my heart, but there's no room for this one. I also really hate giving low reviews for mom&pop places.


I came here around mid-afternoon and there was really not that much to choose from (5 different types of items)... The stuff he did have was in a cake display case so old that the glass was yellowed and I couldn't see through it...or sponge cake.

Being born and raised in Los Angeles, there's a lot of delicious Chinese bakeries and this one is just very meh. I'm keeping AZ in mind but I still can't...

Vanilla sponge cake:
-I give him lots of props for using vanilla bean... you can actually see the little black bits of vanilla bean in this
-Dry on outside rim but acceptable on inside
-Good amount of vanilla flavor

Green tea sponge cake:
-Dry on outside rim of cake, acceptable on inside
-Not a fan of green tea but sometimes green tea flavored things really surprise me and I end up loving it. Did not like this one much between the dry-ness and the tea flavor.
-It was a good amount of green tea flavor... but there was NOTHING else going for this cake.

Japanese cheesecake
-Dry... there's a layer that's mixed in with the cheese and there's another layer that is just cake... the cake was so dry that it was like eating two completely different things in 1. Not good.



Conclusion
-The cakes were dry... I felt like every bite was a sponge soaking in all my saliva and drying my mouth.
-I've just had MUCH MUCH better sponge cake
-Selection of items was slim
-Store needs a serious upgrade..."
