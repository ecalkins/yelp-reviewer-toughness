 We were seated in an awkward sitting area right by the kitchen. I know I shouldn't expect top notch dining service at a pho restaurant  But where I was seated the busboy cart full or dirty dishes was 2 cm right behind  me. 
What was unpleasant was having my seat near the kitchen door with people goin in and out. What was stomach lurching was when I switched seats I had a view of their kitchen which looked grimy. The man at the front counter was wearing sandals when making drinks. A waiter who was taking out the trash I'm not sure if he washed his hands when he was later handling food. 

Our noodle bowl itself was small, but decent. We enjoyed the grilled pork as they were marinated properly. But towards the end the noodles became mushy because of temperature and there wasn't enough  lettuce. The pickled veggies were sad strings.
 We left full but unsatisfied.  .. The pro are the prices but you get what you pay for. This place needs some work.
