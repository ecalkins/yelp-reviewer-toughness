It even got where every one in the grill knew me.  Then I moved to an area without Macaroni Grill.  Yesterday, I went to this Macaroni Grill and to my surprise they do not have whole wheat possible.  Therefore, I was not able to eat there.  Heather (my server) was wonderful and very apologetic for not having what I wanted.  Others were not too thrilled and let me know it.

I suppose the Macaroni Grill drops off of my favorite places to eat."
