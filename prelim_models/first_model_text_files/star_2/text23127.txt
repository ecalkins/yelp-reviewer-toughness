I understand having a simple, small menu, but it goes without saying that then, the items on the menu have to be amazing. It would've been nice to see a grilled chicken option in the burger category.

As far as the service goes, however, they're really nice and efficient at moving through the line and getting orders out. I wish I liked the food more because it really is a great concept!"
