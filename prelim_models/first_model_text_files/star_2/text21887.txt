I've both dined in and ordered take out from this place (because it's close to my house), but I won't buy any more food from this restaurant.  We've ordered orange chicken, sezhuan beef and mixed vege stir fry, among other things.  I totally agree with other reviewers who found the food mostly bland and flavorless.  Portions were also relatively small as I recall, while the prices were proud.  You could get frozen chinese entrees and fried rice from the grocery store and have a better/cheaper meal than this place offers.  In fact, they ought to rename this place So-So Dragon.
