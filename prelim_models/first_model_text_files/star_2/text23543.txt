Seeing how people rave about this place, I thought that I was going to be blown away by an authentic taste, but it was just a basic burger. I was also pretty disappointed in the fries, as they had absolutely no flavor and tasted like they were fried in old oil that hadn't been changed all day, which left a weird after taste. 

The burger was decent, it just didn't have that ""mmmm"" flavor factor that I thought it was going to. Maybe my expectations were too high....and it was almost $10 for just a burger and fries with no drink! For that price, I thought I was going to be hooked but I think I'll just stick to In N Out."
