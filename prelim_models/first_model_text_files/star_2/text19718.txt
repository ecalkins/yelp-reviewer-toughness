Our waitress was strangely rushing us along, even though we weren't meandering about any more than any other time we've gone here. It's nice to talk while we eat, and there were plenty of open tables so it isn't like we were holding up service for other potential patrons.

Anyway, we got club sodas and the waitress put them on the bill as regular drinks. Having been here a couple of times and getting club sodas for free (like water), I presented to her that I had asked the very first time I came and they said it was free and that every subsequent visit they've been free. She informed me of the exact opposite, saying they have always charged for it and pointed to the owner. I said ""All right, well let me talk to the owner."" 

She went to the owner, came back and said ""She won't talk to you, but she says we have always charged for this since we have to pay for the club soda."" I dunno about that last part, seems fishy, but then she said ""You were just lucky the other times."" I joked ""Well, I guess my luck ran out!"" and she just gave me a rude stare; creepy, man.

Food was all right, as per usual, and I didn't even have to pay since my friend was treating my lady and me for our upcoming anniversary, but that kind of inconsistency and customer-blaming is bad service. I'm sure they don't care, as they get 20 bucks a head, but figured I'd mention it anyhow."
