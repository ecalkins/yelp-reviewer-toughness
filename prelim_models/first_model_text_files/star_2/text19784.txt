The sushi rolls were mediocre, like the stuff you can get at the grocery store, the nigri didn't look so fresh, and some fat kid was taking all the stuff before I could grab anything. The restaurant used to be like a clam jumper and they haven't changed the interior up at all. The other asian food was okay, I guess comparable to panda express. I don't think I will ever go back unless someone makes me.
