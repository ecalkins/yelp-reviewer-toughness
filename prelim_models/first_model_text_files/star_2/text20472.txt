My bottom bun was soggy and the chicken tasted like it was boiled totally bland, along with the curly fries. My friend said his tasted the same too. I gave them a extra star cause the bartender Karen was very polite and attentive but the rest of the staff could care less about the customers. I asked the other bartender if they were busy today she said no and that hey're never busy. I wonder why?
