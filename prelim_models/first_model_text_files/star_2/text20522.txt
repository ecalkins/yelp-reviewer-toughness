It is beyond me how a large corporate chain can have such bad service!!  Our server was super sweet but our table of 10 was too much for her.  

(We eat out at restaurants 5-6 times a week and know good service.)

They need bus boys to help the servers.  They also apparently need managers that know how to run a restaurant.  Our server didn't get ANY HELP BRINGING OUT our food for 10 PEOPLE!!!!   SHE BROUGHT THEM OUT 2 AT A TIME & VERY SLOWLY!  I got my food last and the first people were done eating already.  

I never even saw a manager around.  They never came by to see how our meal was going -- most restaurants have a manager come by for larger parties.  

BOTH VISITS THEY MESSED UP RUNNING THE CARDS.  In April, the waiter ran my card for the whole bill on my card (when we had written out how much to put on 4 cards).   They reversed the charge that day, but they NEVER TOLD ME they ran it & it TOOK 3 days to get the $300 credit back from the bank!!  

The reviews at all locations are low.  The chain needs a major over-haul before they go out of business!!"
