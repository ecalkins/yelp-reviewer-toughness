I've been now over a dozen times and not once have i received anything but incompetent service. The deli host 4 young and inexperienced staff, doing about a third of the output it should. Same with the checkout counters. Slow, mistakes, and completely unkind. It is frustrating, having such a great store but managed so poorly.
