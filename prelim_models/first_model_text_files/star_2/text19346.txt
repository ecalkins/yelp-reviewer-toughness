There was about 5 games that took our money and no game. We only complained about one. We had to ask for someone at the prize counter and in the middle of our transaction the manager came over and took the lady who was taking care of us to go over to the laser maze and help other people. We stood at the counter for 10 min before the manager walked by and I said ""hey that was extremely rude for her to be helping us and then run off to help the next people in line, w/out saying anything. He apologized, but at that point we were already over it."
