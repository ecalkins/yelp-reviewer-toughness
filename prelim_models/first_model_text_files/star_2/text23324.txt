Don't get me wrong, the burgers are decent. They are fresh and better than most drive-thru burgers. The fries, on the other hand, are sub-par. They are soggy and tasteless. 

It makes me sad to see The Stand get rid of what made them unique. The last thing Arcadia needs is another burger spot. However, burgers AND tacos? That's something I can get behind."
