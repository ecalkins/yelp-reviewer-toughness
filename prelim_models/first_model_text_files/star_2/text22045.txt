I'm not sure if the chef taste the food when it comes out but he or she should start! Cocktail sauce that come out with our seafood tower was over powering with horseradish, which is a understatement. If you have a clogged nose I suggest having some. It will clear that right up. The one thing I will say is the waitress did tell us that there was a lot of horseradish in it. I figured ok a little bite to it I prefer it like that, but whoa you couldn't eat it! The ahi tuna looked and tasted a little suspect. They did substitute some shrimp for it. Crab legs are split and cold. Problem is think they keep them on ice. The bottom part of the crab was literally frozen. Ok on to soup and salad. Prob best part of the meal. Entrees there was 4 of us 2 of us are pretty picky so surprise surprise of course we didn't like it. But the 2 that weren't didn't like there's either. Prime rib was tuff not like a prime rib should be. Even the au jus came out luke warm at best and flavorless. Fish had no flavor. One got NY Strip and asked for Med-well (which I think ruins it). That came out charred on the outside and med-rare. The sides weren't even good. Asparagus overcooked and way to much lemon. The ""smashed"" red potatoes temp wise were closer to the cold side with no flavor. I will say the service wasn't terrible and the manager did take his time to stop by and talk with us. Overall wouldn't bother wasting my time there nor would I suggest you waste your time or money, even if the casino is going to comp it!"
