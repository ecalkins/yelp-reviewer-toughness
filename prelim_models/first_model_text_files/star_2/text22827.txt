The burger was really good, but the fries were not and the five different Aioli sauces weren't that great either. The price for the two items were $14 - a little high, but I wouldn't mind the price if I loved the food. After about ten minutes after eating, my stomach was a little upset. Not sure if it was the Aioli sauces or the burger. Either way, I didn't feel good so I'm not sure if I will be back.
