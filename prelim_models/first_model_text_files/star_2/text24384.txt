Back there, we also tried the 'Join the wait list' feature from Yelp, and it worked wonders.

We get back home and hubby wanted to go to Oregano's again for dinner for us and our guests.

I checked the wait time and joined the wait list through Yelp. All the time during the drive there we were raving about how much we liked the sausage appetizer. Then we arrive at the estimated time just to be told the details in the app are not correct and there is an additional 30-35 minute wait.

That is what I call over promising and under delivering, which is usually very bad for businesses.

Needless to say we were very disappointed and did not want to wait.
We went to Olive Garden, got a booth right away and enjoyed a delicious meal with my always favorite Zuppa Tuscana.

We may give Oregano another chance but this was not a good experience."
