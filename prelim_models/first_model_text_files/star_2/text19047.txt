Parking was in a private lot and there were a few spaces. We walk in and the restaurant was big and packed too but we were acknowledged right away. I gave two fingers to the host and she says, ""wait one minute."" I find it hilarious that this statement could come off rude in which I kind of took it that way. Eh, whatever. 

So we get a table and we order vermicelli bowls - one with bbq pork and eggrolls and one with bbq shrimp. When we got the food, the bowls are slightly smaller than Pho Thanh. The flavor was fine. I was starving so I left nothing in my bowl. Server wasn't attentive, he placed our order, gave our check and that was it.

We paid - $15 excluding tip. I prefer my first choice than here but it is a good alternative for Vietnamese food in the area."
