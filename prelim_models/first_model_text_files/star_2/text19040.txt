WHen I got up to look for someone  they were sitting at a table just relaxing.  Our food was literally tossed to us without any regard to whom it was going to.  My friend asked for two seperate items on the menu and was told ""they were out"".  for two items, one after the other?  I have had PHO at many places.  I WILL NOT be returning, my recommendation would be to go to MAXIM  up the street on 19th ave and Osborn.  This place was the pits!"
