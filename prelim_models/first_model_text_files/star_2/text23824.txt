More often than not there is barely any cream cheese.  Twice they have put a solid half inch layer on the whole bagel!  Yesterday I bought a chocolate cream filled donut.  Almost no powdered sugar on the outside, barely any cream on the inside.  This store needs to get up to standard and stay there!
