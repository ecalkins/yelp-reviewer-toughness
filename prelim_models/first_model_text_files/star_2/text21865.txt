Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, ""Hmm"" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.

There are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here."
