After we were seated, we chose the fried squid, fried shrimp with sugar cane, and sticky rice from the dimsum cart. They were stone cold and hard. The manager's response was ""it is dimsum; it goes around the room."" It only told me that the turnover was not high on certain foods and yet they chose to prepare them anyway and serve them after they are past acceptable. I have had dimsum in other cities and have NEVER had cold food that was supposed to be hot, dimsum cart or not. Just to be fair, the siomai, gai lan and jellyfish were okay. They were tasty and were the acceptable temperature for food going around a large room in a cart. That's the one star you earned. The noodles? It would have been nice if you added a few vegetables aside from the onions.

As for the service, it was fine. Our server was a sweet older lady who was very helpful and attentive. That is the second and final star you are getting from me.

Sad. Where else do we go for dimsum in Arizona? I suppose I will wait until I am out of town where they have real dimsum fare as I will be hardpressed to return here."
