When we arrived it was 7:20pm and we where rushed to order and then when we decided what we wanted we where told that they don't have it because it takes too long to make. Its was crazy to think that 40 minuets was not enough time to make rice with beef. 
I ended up ordering the Pho and iced coffee and my husband decided not to eat. My daughter shared my food and although the customer service was horrible the food was good. 
Also, my daughter (2 years old) broke a pepper shaker and the waiter proceeded to scold her as she tried to grab the salt shaker, I'm sorry but please don't talk to my daughter. Leave that for us- her parents!"
