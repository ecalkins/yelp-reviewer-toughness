For a lot less that $20, I can find everything available here, except the prime rib, for a lot less elsewhere.  There was the potential for a wide variety of sushi, except the platters were always empty.  There was gelato, but only three flavors since they were out of chocolate and mint chocolate chip.  

With better prices and lots of coupon deals at Oriental Buffet, and a better selection for a few dollars more at Wandering Horse Buffet, this place seems to be caught in the never land middle ground."
