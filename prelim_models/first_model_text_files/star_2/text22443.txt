Handed immense menus, with an intimidating list of items. Server was absolutely disinterested in talking to us, and seemed somewhat impatient when asked for recommendations, as if we were dullards totally unfamiliar with the process of ordering something. He pointed to a series of items that appeared arbitrary, but I just just kinda went along with it because I really wanted to see what they had to offer. I was unimpressed by absolutely everything that was brought out, with the most offensive being a plate of sweet ribs that managed to be tough, greasy, sticky, and oily at the same time. Not everything was terrible, but none of it left a positive impression. 

Maybe there's something worth ordering here, but I didn't have it."
