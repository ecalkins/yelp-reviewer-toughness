They give you free bread. I pigged out and got the italian nachos - sounds weird but that was the best thing I had.
Middle of our dinner was interrupted by the 'entertainment' - a man yelling at the crowd about this italian song and that, then he started singing and wanted everyone to clap. Sorry, I'm just too cool (others may say uptight) to do that. Luckily my back was facing him it wasn't hard to ignore.
By the time my food came out I was thoroughly stuffed, so I just ate a few bites and put the rest in a box.

The food prices were very reasonable - I'd bet if they charged more nobody would visit, though.

Strangely the next day when I ate my leftovers they tasted much, much better. I guess hunger is the best spice!

I've been to other Macaroni grills and they just seemed to be better than this place."
