When you are paying $13 for a burger and fries - and have to sit outside in Phoenix to eat it, you expect everything to be very good.

Today I put in my order and as I was paying I asked for the wifi password.  The young woman at the register said they didn't have wifi.  Well, they do, and right behind her shoulder was a Nest Thermostat - which only works off of wifi.  I pointed this out to her and she said nobody knows the password.  Ok, fine.  You don't want to provide a free thing to your customers I guess that is your prerogative.

I ordered my burger without tomato.  I said it twice to make sure she got that.

Normal wait time, she delivers my burger and fries.  The fries were 300 degrees and had about a quart of excess oil on them.

The burger...  of course it had tomatoes on it.

Then, when I take my first big bite of burger the other woman comes right to my table as I bite down and stands there asking me questions about how my meal was.  Seriously?  She stands there chuckling as I have to chew with her staring at me.  This made everything taste like garbage.  That is THE worst move in a restaurant and for that I'll never return to this one.  I'm still seething that she had to RUIN the meal that I paid and tipped well for.  I was about the 15th customer of the day, and my $2 in the jar were the only $2 in the jar.

A few blocks east on the south side of the street is the Chicago Hamburger company.  Go there.  They don't try and hijack your meal there and have enough seating inside for their customers."
