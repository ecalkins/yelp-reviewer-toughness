I ordered the bahn mih and one of the vermecelli plates with grilled meat and egg rolls... and it was just alright.  The price was about right for comparable food but I was definitely expecting A LOT more of the bahn mih (it sucked compared to Lee's Sandwiches; the bread was too bready and NOT a baguette but instead that used for a sub sandwich).  The neighborhood was also sketch.  I came here on a weekday around 3pm and there were some strange characters hanging out in front.
