This Oregano's blows compared to the Tempe/Scottsdale one and they're not that much better.
Poor service, food is a little off and the building is too damn small. 
Might as well go to Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo and have an enjoyable lunch/dinner.
Plus they're overpriced due to the valley's sick obsession with Oregano's."
