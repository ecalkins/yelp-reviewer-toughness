Food came out FAST
LOTS of food, and cheap too!

The Cons:
Everything that came out of the kitchen was premanufactured. Frozen fries, frozen wings, canned chili, canned cheese sauce. Wings were frozen and precooked so when they were cooked again for our order they were overdone. 

After many many years of driving by this building I finally came in. Not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place. If yours are, you will not be underwhelmed either. It's basically bar food but without the bar. Not the worst I've ever had by any stretch, but never a place I'd circle a date on the calendar for. I'd come back simply for the volume of food and price point."
