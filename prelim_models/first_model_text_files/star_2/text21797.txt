0	Husband and I went tonight. Customer service is pretty good, but the food wasn't. We ordered PuPu appetizer and the meat items tasted old or like they were reheated. Food was definitely hot, temperature wise. Water doesn't taste very good. Husband got the shrimp egg fu young, came with a very dark sauce, not gravy like he's accustomed to. He didn't like it and ended up asking for orange chicken instead which he said was ok. I had kung pao chicken. Not enough veggies or peanuts (which seemed kind of stale). They were kind of stingy with the steamed rice too. Chicken in both dishes, for me, was stringy chewy. Won't be back.
