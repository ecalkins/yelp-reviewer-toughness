There are five different menus plastered ON the counter and on the window where you USED to be able to watch the guy make sushi. The lights and TV are turned off over one of the dining areas because ""no one sits there"". I didn't want to say it's because they don't have enough business. I'd write a longer review but the AC is turned off for some reason in late May and it's getting uncomfortable."
