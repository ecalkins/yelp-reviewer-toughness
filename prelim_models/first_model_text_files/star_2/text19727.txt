After today , I don't think that me and my daughter are going back. I will not recommend it to others either. 

The sushi - were pathetic. It did not seem fresh and it did not taste fresh. Remember that we were there at 11:30. You would think that it will taste fresh. Second , it feels like you have to always wait for the chef to replenish the food bar at all times. This would include the
TEMPURA BAR. They fill it with vegetable and you can count the shrimp.

Over all, I can find better place to eat lunch. 
JASMINE TOKYO please step up and improve your food serving ! 

UN-HAPPY CUSTOMER !"
