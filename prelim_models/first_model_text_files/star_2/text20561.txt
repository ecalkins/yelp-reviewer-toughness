Our appetizer the mozzarella was over cooked and was more like potato chips, the bread was in short supply and took forever.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive on our table.  To top it off, the waitress, didn't listen on how we wanted to split our bill and one of our party had to walk to her to coach her on how we wanted the check split.  Nothing hard either, split the bill, apply my $20 giftcard to my portion and bill me the balance.  While I don't blame the waitress for the slow service due to short staffing, I'm glad I don't come often.  Now I understand why.  For the money, there are plenty of other Italian choices.  Enough said.
