After we received our bag, we we noticed we were missing a hamburger and had to enter the Restaurant to get our missing hamburger. Once we got the missing hamburger we noticed that the patties were burned, all the toppings were missing, and the buns were flat. Maybe they were just busy but we won't be returning to this Culver's.
