Came here on a Friday night - HUGE place but maybe only a quarter full.  Lots of sushi to choose from but I'm pretty sure it's been sitting out since lunch.  Shriveled with crunchy rice ain't the way to go - and oh my that kim chi looked like it dried out yesterday.  

On the plus side, the stuff that came out fresh was pretty good - i.e., they cranked out some Korean BBQ ribs fresh out the wok and and that was fine.  Beef and broccoli was pretty tasty, and the crawfish were nice and spicy (a bit rubbery from being out too long though).

All in an average experience.  Would have been 3 stars, but at $50 for two people I expect things to be a bit more fresh.  Oh well, a good buffet needs high turnover and they just don't have enough traffic to sustain such a huge spread.  Hope I don't get sick :)"
