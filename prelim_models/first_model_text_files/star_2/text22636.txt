Shortly after walking in, we were seated but no one came to take our drink order for at least 10 minutes and then it was only because we said something to a waiter walking by.  The Dim Sum selection was very small and the quality just wasn't that good.  

Who charges for refills on a fountain drink anymore?

They did have a shrimp/crab egg roll that was real good!

I think you will find me at C-Fu Gourmet from now on."
