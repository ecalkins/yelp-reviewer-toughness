Honestly, the ice cream menu seems to be lacking. You really just choose a basic ice cream flavor and add toppings, nothing special at all. I got vanilla ice cream with brownie bits which was tasty, but I just found the lack of selection odd. 

I didn't order any food but I saw another table with a bunch of burgers that were in sealed plastic pouches. It looked ridiculous. Like is this place supposed to be space themed with burgers in plastic pouches and cement ice cream? Just consider me confused. Maybe I'm just unwilling to change, but I think I'll stick with better ice cream places."
