The Hooters girls were very nice although a bit forgetful, on both occasions. Also, they seem a bit confused as to who's table is who's. Then there's an awkward moment when they're both standing at the table ready to take our order. This happened both times I was there, kinda uncomfortable. 
Also, I understand their shtick is to have pretty girls waiting on you, but when their hair is long and flowing everywhere, especially when they're playing with it while working, it's not very sanitary. They should maybe have pony tails or have it pinned back somehow no? 

The food. The wings are just ok...in my opinion they're not a as fresh as other Hooters restaurants. Also, the fries were stale, like they had been sitting there for days and the cook nuked them in the micro for a minute before serving! Also, I order 10 wings and when they arrived the waitress stated that she owes me 3 because 3 fell on the ground. I never saw those wings...not surprised. I understand the wait staff is young but I think a bit more training would go a long way. No more Hooters in Scottsdale for me!"
