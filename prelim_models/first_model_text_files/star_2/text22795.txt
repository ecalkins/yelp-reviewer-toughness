I tried the Falafel Burger with lettuce wrap instead of bun and for one dollar up charge I got the 3 Cheese Macaroni and Cheese Bites. It seemed like they hollowed out a WHOLE lettuce head for my sandwich (see photo) I adjusted the amount of lettuce and for the most part the Falafel Sandwich and Bites were delicious.....but then things go south fast.

We shared the Roasted Farm Vegetables. (see photo)
They looked like broken down leftovers that were full of grease and were sort of burnt. The vegetables came with a very non-traditional romesco. (romesco is suppose to be a red pepper nut sauce)

My husband asked for his Aioli Burger with the aioli on the side but that request was ignored so he sent it back. Big mistake...I don't know what they did but it seemed like they washed the burger off and threw it back on the heat......because.....
Instead of a ""Pink"" Burger (you order pink or well) he received a petrified burger and pulled it out of his sandwich and said to me that it was dryer than a Burger King Patty and too dry to feed our dogs. The girl working the counter said that she was sorry but it wasn't her fault because she ordered the burger correctly.

The other girl from the kitchen came out to clear the plates saw the dried up burger and said she'd make a new one but we were passing out the door to leave so we just left.

Aioli Burger made Delicious Fresh Burgers at the past Devoured Festival....I thought they'd be just as good from the restaurant but I was wrong."
