But clearly, I can hear all the noise coming from inside which is making it hard for her to hear me. The speaker box is up high how am I suppose to get close? I drive up to the window and I get no salutation and don't even get noticed for almost 10 minutes. There were no other cars in line. And it was just after 12pm. Finally get my order. 
Tacos not too bad. They're suppose to come with salsa, neither one of my tacos had any salsa. I also ordered chips and salsa on the side, the tiny containers are ridiculous. These containers are the kind you see at other places where you pack salsa to go. In my opinion, the salsa was not enough. The chips are tasty but a little hard to chew. First few were nice and crunchy, then they started getting dull and greasy. 
I like supporting local businesses, but not sure I'll return. Good luck."
