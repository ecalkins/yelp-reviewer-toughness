And I feel bad for the two star because I like rooting for the small businesses of the world, this just doesn't deserve the stars it does have.  It's a little strip mall dive, which I'm good with and can add to the experience.  It didn't.  The dive was dirty and the ""dude"" behind the counter with the beard gave some of the most lackluster service I've had in a while.  Couldn't hear him, didn't help or suggest anything.  The big miss though was the food.  $7 for an a la carte specialty burger.  Doesn't sound horrible, but it was horribly overpriced when I realized $7 was for a burger barely larger than a slider.  The menu states it is over 1/4 lb, but I doubt it was even a 1/4 lb.  I can get a full 1/2 lb burger at most places in town with a side between $8-$10.  With fries and a drink I was at $12 for a lil burger in a dive?  Part of a cool dive or diner is the value, either the massive portion or the low price as it typically doesn't have the ridiculous overhead of a Houstons or even a Zinburger.  This had neither.  Now for the real bummer, it was supposed to be a Southern Fried burger with gravy & onion strings.  I can't believe I forgot to take a picture of this disappointment but it had almost no gravy and what it did have was like a white flavorless paste.  Sadly in spite of everyone else's rave reviews that led this place to pop up on my radar I will not likely be heading there again.  Closer to 1.5 stars."
