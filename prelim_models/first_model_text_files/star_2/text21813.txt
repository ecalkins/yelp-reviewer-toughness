Anyway it didn't taste fresh and was very bland and very fishy ,egg drop soup had a very slimy texture actually had to spit them both out on plate. lost my appetite at this point and asked waitress it she could take this off the bill as I did want anything else . She said she didn't think so and would check with owner . She returned and said owner said no but I could replace it with something else. I really didn't want anything else but settled for the leomon  chicken . Chilli Sea Bass was about $ 24 egg drop soup about $5 and Leomon Chicken about $13 , couldn't  get adjustment on bill and we did leave a tip. Needless to say we wont be back here again or recommend to anyone even though Leomon chicken was okay the next day.
