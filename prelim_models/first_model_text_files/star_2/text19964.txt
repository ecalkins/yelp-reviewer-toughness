0	The food was only ok, and considering the price, it was good that I got 10% off with Check-In through YELP.  The place was huge, very spacious and plenty of seating.  The buffet was extra big compared to most.  Lots of various dishes; however, many were only lukewarm and the Sushi was primarily rolls of various names/preparations.  Not a lot of sashimi or nigiri items.  The service was ok as well.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to dine here.
