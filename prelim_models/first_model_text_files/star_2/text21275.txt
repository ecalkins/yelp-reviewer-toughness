It's been over a year since we've eaten here last and I thought it would be the same or even better but we found ourselves leaving, thinking we should have stopped by the Islands restaurant or In-N-Out maybe.  

I had their special, Batter Up for $9.50.  Not sure why this thing cost some much.  It had two patties (it needs two patties since they are uber small) a couple of small slices of kielbasa topped with BBQ potatoes chips.  It was okay, nothing I would ever order again.  My son had their Paradise cheese burger.  It was much better than mine for $3 less however my son did not like the cucumbers on the burger nor did I.  Wifey had their tacos which she really enjoyed.  We ordered H2O to drink however it was cucumber infused water that tasted like it needed a refresher or something, very stale.  The sweet tater tots were okay, but they were a bit mushy.  

If you like cucumbers, this is totally the place for you! 

(Side note to the owner/manager your music was a little loud.  We were struggling to hear our convo.   You also need to wash off your front side walk and tables to make a better impression with your customers)."
