Just make sure you're in a forgiving mood, because their service is really gonna test you. Rude and careless order taking, forgotten dishes, slow delivery, they'll throw it all at you. But, when your burger finally arrives with all its unique scrumptiousness, you might just forgive their insolence. Maybe.

Also, don't know if the order taker was under some influence, but when I asked for a water cup he handed me one full of ice with bite marks all around the rim. Didn't end up getting a drink.

2 1/2 stars would be more accurate."
