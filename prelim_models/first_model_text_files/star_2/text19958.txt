Let's talk about service... If you get a lady named Vickie you are going to have a bad time. She never came to ask us how everything was which I don't expect much since it's a buffet. But we weren't even eating dessert yet and she brought us our bill. She even lectured us about how much to eat! Seriously rude! I gave her the 10% off yelp check-in to adjust our bill and when she brought it back she pretty much threw the bill at us. This was probably the worst service I've ever had. We also overheard her complain to the other customers about why she didn't get a tip. They said the service was horrible. At first I thought that was rude but now I know exactly why!!"
