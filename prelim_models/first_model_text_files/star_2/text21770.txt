Doesn't get more Americanized Chinese than this - your sweet & sour chicken, your Mongolian beef, your walnut prawns....and you realize you're the only one in a packed restaurant at lunchtime actually eating with chopsticks (given upon request). The few times been here for lunch the food has been nominal. Decent but nothing that stayed with me, except that typical post Chinese-lunch craving for a massive nap. 

Service...well, depends on the server. Some are friendly, some not so much. Prices for the lunch special hover around $5.50 and include egg flower or hot & sour soup, entree, fried rice, and the greasiest egg roll that ever egg rolled. 

Chinatown this isn't, but Grandma Ethel would love it. Actually make that plural Grandma Ethels. They were all over, rockin the place."
