There's a sign that all meat is prepared every single morning but what good is that if you give me a PRECOOOKED burger. A burger that even with sauce, which is a strange concoction, bacon that had the texture of jerky and roasted jalape√±o, that was still bland. It must've been bland because all the salt was in my fries. 
The only reason 2 stars are being given is because of the Salted Dulce de Leche shake. It was delicious."
