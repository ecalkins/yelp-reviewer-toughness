They have two Bowling options, covered under various packages one is the full bowling one is mini bowling which is nice. They have a typical slew of arcade games, but none of those are included in any of their packages they range about 75 cents apiece except pool is 2.50 which is a lot. The bumper cars are pretty good it's probably one of their best features..  they called blast pads  I think. They have a small laser tag area. One of my favorite arcade type of games is air hockey and I was disappointed to find out they have old air hockey tables that don't work very well. I can't tell if it's the table or the pucks or a mixture of both I think it's mostly just old crappy tables. For the same amount of money in good weather I would definitely rather Castles and Coasters. The atmosphere is ok it is definitely filled with very small children even though it's pretty entertaining for children I would say up to low teens max. Mostly soccer mom's and bratty 5-7 yr olds.  If you want a true amusement park experience with a more general diverse crowd , lots of better ride I would definitely do castles and coasters. The location is kind of out in the middle of nowhere in far southeast Gilbert..  I ordered an $11 burger and the amount of fries that I got with it was about the size of the McDonalds small fries not kidding. See photo..

To make a long story short its not worth it to pay $21 a person just to have access to a tiny laser tag area, a few bumper cars and basically one other tiny thing. Everything else cost extra after your in"
