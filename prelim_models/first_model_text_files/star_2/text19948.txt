Couldn't fool me with  the redundant puny sushi rolls stuffed with the same miniscule ingredients.  Tempura batter tasteless and the shrimp not cleaned well within.  The last time we went was when they first opened, I guess they've managed to stay in business by serving lackluster food somehow. 

I've never left a buffet on an empty belly until now.  I'm going to top off somewhere else."
