Once the cooked dishes were empty, the cookers did not prepare new one. This happened included roasted duck, fruit (watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe.), and deep fried shrimps. I understand business may want to save some dimes for not bringing out dishes as frequent as possible to save its margin, yet it is unacceptable for Scottsdale buffet restaurant that charge over $22 per person to keep empty dishes over 15 minute's time frame in a non-rush hour. Inside the restaurant, there were at least twenty people in here. 
I wish the management can make improvements on the food control and dessert table in the future."
