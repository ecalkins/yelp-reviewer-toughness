Girl gave us our ice cream (she called it ice cream even though it's allegedly custard) and then we waited over 5 minutes for our burgers. Basically the custard was melted by the time we got it home. Should use more thought when handing food to customer when you know it's 100 degrees outside. The Culver's we used to go to in IL was always a positive experience. This location needs to get it together.

Paid a lot for poor service."
