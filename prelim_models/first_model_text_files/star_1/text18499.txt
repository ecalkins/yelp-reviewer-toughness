Today after waiting for 15 minutes for a table we were called up for seating. 2 of our party were in the bathroom & there was a line. I explained this to the hostess & was told by the manager & the hostess that we would not be seated until they came out. I said we all walked in together you saw us. They said they would not seat us. Finally after another 10 minutes out came the rest of our party.  

I was so taken back by this rule of every member of your party being present to get a seat, I opted to leave. In an area were breakfast restaurants are plentiful I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again. 

If your looking for a breakfast place I would recommend Butter's or First Awakenings both within 2 miles of Butterfields. Your money is better spent at either of these other 2 restaurants as the service is stellar & the food is delicious."
