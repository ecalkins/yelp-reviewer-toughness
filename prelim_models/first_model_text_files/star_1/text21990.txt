This thing comes to me fresh off the hoof ... I mean it's almost mooing. .. Another waitress seen  my disgust and offers to send it back which I decided no . ... Cuz now I know I am going to get shoe leather back if it goes back into that kitchen. ... Now we are off to desert creme breule. ... We don't really notice until biting into but the sugar on top is burned we work are way around it and when our waiter asked how it was I said burnt. .. He looked at it  the at me at it again and said yup it's a little over done there  ... and still charged me for it LOL ..... I'll never go back not even for a free dinner. ...
