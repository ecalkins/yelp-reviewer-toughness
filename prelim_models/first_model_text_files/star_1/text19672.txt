I love wings and I'm always looking for new places to try. When I walked in, I was not impressed, it was very cluttered but I kept an open mind..I wasn't there for the view..I was there for the food. When I received my dozen wings,they came out on a Styrofoam 5-part throw away plate. The entire bottom was covered in oil and grease. The wings were fried past the point of being able to salvage any meat off of them. I couldn't even taste the sauce.. All I could taste was grease. I could only stomach eating 4 out of the 12. I ate two wings and two legs hoping i had a few bad ones... But I could clearly see by looking at them the whole order was uneatable. I thought about complaining, but it just wasn't worth my time or energy. I was completely shocked this'd place was busy and has the reviews it has. If you don't care how your food tastes, then I say this is the place for you, it's affordable and the staff is nice. But if your like me and have some standard to your food order... stay away from here, don't even waste your time or $7.00. It's a dump in more ways then one. I didn't even want to give it a star.
