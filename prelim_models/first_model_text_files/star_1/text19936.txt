Aside from the sign and a few decorative asian trinkets here and there there is nothing to make this place feel like an ""asian buffet"". There are faux stone walls and a huge stone fireplace. The thing that got me though was the antler chandeliers...  Antler... Chandeliers... The music they played was 90's soft rock. We mentioned it to the server but she said that she had no control over the music choice. The buffett itself was way too expensive in my opinion. We went for dinner and it was 19.99 per person that with one ice tea each came to a bill of almost $80 for three people! And if you don't like seafood (as I do not) then your selections are rather limited. 75% of the buffett was seafood and sushi. The other 25% was everything else so I felt like my meal was not as varied as I would like. The food I did eat was good. You just got that really hard, dried out piece of something every once in a while. For the price my dad joked that they should offer cots in back to sleep it off before coming back for another round."
