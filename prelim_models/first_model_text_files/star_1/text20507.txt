Four tables occupied, not too many clients, but service was absolutely atrocious. Took forever to request orders for drinks and even longer to place food orders. Waiter was swamped elsewhere so he made mistakes in the orders. One member of our party was upset at getting the wrong order  after waiting thirty minutes, she cancelled her dinner, not willing to wait another long period of time before receiving her corrected order.

Not the waiter's fault, we understand that. Don't know what happened to this place, used to be a terrific restaurant.  The food was good, so for that, they get the one star."
