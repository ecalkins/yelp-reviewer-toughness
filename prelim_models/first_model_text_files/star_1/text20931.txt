I weight around 183lbs and after finishing a Burger with fries and a drink still felt hungry, and I mean a lot.  I think the chef should focus more in bringing natural big flavor to his burgers instead of plain sugar.  Like poblano peppers, chipotle, caramelized onions, jalapenos, Blue Cheese and not just rely on the show Tripple D for its reputation.
