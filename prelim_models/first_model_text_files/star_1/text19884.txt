Although only about 5 customers there, we had to walk around and track down
our ""server"" 3x!
Even better... We asked if we could take the bones from our ribs home for our five
Rescue dogs. Server said OK, we wrapped them in napkins.
Leaving the restaurant, the ""manager"" starts yelling ""you can't take those with you!!""
Even though we showed her they were only bones, & that our long-lost server said it was fine, she kept ranting that she would charge us $4.99 per pound for the bones!
Hard to believe, huh??? But, who on earth could make this up?!
So folks, if you want to go someplace to be humiliated, lied to, and made to feel
totally insignificant, this is the place for you...I know we never will return, & will
certainly warn others!"
