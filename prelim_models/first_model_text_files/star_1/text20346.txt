Well the place was just purchased by a new owner and the guy seems to not give a crap.  Never once has he come over to the table and said how's your food etc.   The people are not very friendly , and this is the honest truth.   I have been there about a dozen times since the new owners purchased it and they have not gotten the food order right once.  I order the same thing every time  a teriyaki chicken combo and a Mitzu soup with a drink.  One would think the soup would come out first but nope.  It all comes out at the same time and the last few times the food has been cold along with the soup.  Do they EVER APPOLIGIZE nope.  They really don't care and if they don't care I will find another place to go.  They just lost a two to three day a week customer.  Today was funny they forgot to bring my food out after waiting 20 + minutes.  They double delivered an order to the guy next to me.  Another table had to go up and complain three times to get their order.  It's like a circus of errors and comedy.
