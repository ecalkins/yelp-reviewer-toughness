First, the good stuff.  Lots of variety.  Very clean.  Staff is friendly and helpful without being obsequious.  

But ultimately, it's the food one goes to a restaurant for, and in this the place fails.  Food that should have been warm wasn't.  Sushi didn't look, taste, or have the texture of fresh.  Rolls mostly tasted the same - couldn't tell one from the other.  

Desserts?  Again, lots of options, all mediocre.

Felt it was really a waste of money.  Won't be back."
