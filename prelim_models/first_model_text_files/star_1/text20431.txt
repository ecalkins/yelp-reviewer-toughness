We came in after the baseball game at 4pm ordered right away, the waitress was attentive in welcoming us and getting our order. After that it all went downhill very quick, an hour wait still no food we ask what's the issue and they say should be coming out soon. We wait another 30 min and part of the food comes out cold, still where missing 4 people including my kids food, the waitress comes over informed us that they lost our ticket which is why it took so long for our order to come out. We request to speak to the manager and inform him the food is cold and on top of that it's not complete. We finally got the rest of our order and thankfully my kids food was warm but our friends nachos where a joke zero cheese and meet. After 2 hours we again talk to the manager tell him this was unacceptable he did apologize and say he would take some of the items off our bill which I was thankful for, however he leaves with our tickets doesn't come back. We get the server to see what's going on since we just want to get out at that point, she brings us the check only to find since we split it the discount was gone, again get the manager involved and says I'll fix it now at 2.5 hours here we get our ticket to pay. What an extremely poor managed place, the manager apologized said he messed up on 4 other orders as well which I don't care I just wanted to get out and leave. The funny thing is he got into an argument with a customer who wanted to watch a show on the tv and told him there's a dennys down the road super rude of that comment. I would recommend not going here especially when there are other chains across the street with much better service and food.
