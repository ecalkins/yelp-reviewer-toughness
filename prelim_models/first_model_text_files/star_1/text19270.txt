I took advantage of this offer and when I came back to use the card (which never left my wallet)- they accused us of using it the day prior and said it was no good. Total guilty until proven innocent approach, which did not make for a good experience.  Staff is young which I get, but Management didn't do much to make this unpleasant situation better either.  I understand since they are new, and still working out some of the processes, but customer service should never be sacraficed along the way."
