Stood in the same spot for 30 minutes in line. The good food is not an excuse for terrible service and a poorly run kitchen which is clearly the problem here. If the line were long but moving then that would be understandable. The line is long and not moving which means they don't have the right food up and ready. 

Also strange that any review that is critical of this restaurant is immediately down votes to not recommended. Funny how that works."
