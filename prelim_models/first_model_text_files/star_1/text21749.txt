I'm stunned at how many people actually like this dive. I've eaten Chinese food all over the city (and all over the world) and this place consistently ranks among the worst. Mongolian Beef? Try Mongolian Mystery Meat. All of the supposedly beef menu items that I've tried have been tough and stringy, I dread to think what kind of meat it really is. 

The spring rolls have the texture of  dried cardboard. Moist cardboard would be an improvement.    

My sister loves this place for some unknown reason and as a result I'm often dragged here for birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations. After 8 visits, I've started eating before I go to this restaurant and when I arrive I'll have a beer and nibble on whatever looks sort of safe.   

I'm willing to concede that it's just me. Perhaps I'm a snob and I'm the only one who's bothered that the pan fried dumplings are soggy and the place just doesn't seem to be that clean.  After all, it's fairly packed when ever I've been there. Lots of Chinese customers... that's supposed to indicate good food, right? 

Despite the audience of loyal followers, I'm not even remotely impressed. And don't get me wrong, I'm not going here expecting Pei Wei of PF Changs, I'm looking for authentic Chinese, sans Jogging Cow. My advice: Look elsewhere."
