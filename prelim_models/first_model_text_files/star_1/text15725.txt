0	True burger Co serves the absolute worst burger I've ever had in my life. I think they microwaved the frozen patty a day before them kept in warm in a steaming tray for 15 hrs before flopping it on the grill for 30 seconds and giving it to me. It took 20 minutes for my girlfriend and my meal to come and cost $55. The meat didn't even taste like hamburger, it was closer to cat food. If you're smart enough to check Yelp before going to a place in the airport don't go here.
