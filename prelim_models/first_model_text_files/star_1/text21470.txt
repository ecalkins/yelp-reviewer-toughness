I've wanted to come here FOREVER, and the day before my birthday (July 1), my friend wanted to take me to a quick dinner and let me choose.  I chose here without hesitation.  
We arrived in the strip mall where PVBC is located and when we crossed over the threshold of the restaurant, I nearly fell and broke my neck on the greasy floor!  Thank god my friend was behind me and snatched me up or else I probably would have hurt myself.  I literally slid the whole way to the register where I grabbed a menu and began to look it over.  I chose the daily special (some ""Denver"" themed burger), and my friend got a standard burger.  We then slipped and slid across the greasy floor and attempted to find a clean table.  There weren't any.  I actually had to go grab napkins and go wet one in the ladies room so I could come back and wipe down the table we decided to sit at.  
While waiting for our food to come out, I tried to look through the windows outside but they were cloudy and smeared with (you guessed it)...grease!  My friend and I both commented in unison just how disgusting the inside of the restaurant was.  Really...it was unbelievable.  I know that burgers and fries are greasy...I get that there is going to be residual grease throughout the place, especially because it's a super small space, but come on!  
By the time our food arrived, I really wasn't hungry anymore but ate half of my burger anyway.  It was good but my stomach was not pleased an hour later. My friend also had some stomach ""discomfort"" when he got home.  
For those of you who swear by this place, more power to you, but I just can't bring myself to ever return to a place like this.  Sorry."
