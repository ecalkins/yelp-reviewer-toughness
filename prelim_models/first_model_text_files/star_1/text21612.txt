Got a very dry burger, that was cold, didn't see any ""Fresno peppers pickled in whiskey "" and the sauce came on the side but had no flavor! And I guess I ordered the kid size fries cause the bag was only half full and they were cold too. All around disappointing experience. Don't bother trying this place had a better burger at McDonald's"
