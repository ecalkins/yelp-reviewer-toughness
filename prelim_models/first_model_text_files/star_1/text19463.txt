While I was deciding what to order, a worker wearing gloves brought out a tray of food to a customer's table and then she came over to the register and started taking our order. Halfway thru the order, another girl came and took over to finish typing it into the register. The girl that had been touching dirty plastic trays and typing on the dirty register then went back and started assembling a hamburger for someone while wearing the same gloves. I don't have OCD but I can't stand it when a worker is wearing gloves to prepare food and then touching other things (register keypads, serving trays). Why even wear gloves at all?
