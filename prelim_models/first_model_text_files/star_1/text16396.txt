No way is this place worth standing in line for over 3 hours.  If the parking lot is full, just keep driving. 

The single sausage bite sample and empty tap water coolers while waiting 3 hours in little to no shade is what you should expect. 

If you want repeat business LMB, work on your customer service. 

The perky cashiers looking for a tip don't make the lines any better."
