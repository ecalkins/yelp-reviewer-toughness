That last time I attended I made the decision to never step foot in this place again. I went with my boyfriend one afternoon, it was not busy at all. We were bowling and waiting and hour before someone came over to ask us if we would like to order anything. And the only reason they asked was because the waitress's family started a game of bowling in the lane next to us. I was outraged, I went and asked for the manager. Come to find out the group of people that were standing in a circle and chatting, one of them was a manager. He was so unprofessionalism. He did nothing for us. We finished our game and left. We wrote a review on Facebook and was personally contacted by someone higher up. We wanted nothing they had to offer. All it took was for the employees to do their job, which is why they are paid to be there in the first place. Worst customer experience ever. To this day I will not recommend or step foot back in the building. Don't waste your time here
