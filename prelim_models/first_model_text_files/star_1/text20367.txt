Things are more expensive now, rivalling Stingray, which is worth the price. The atmosphere is cluttered with obnoxious signs everywhere in bright colors, the menu is glued to the counter with plastic covering it. I felt like i was in Tijuana! The counter help even called my order to the kitchen in Spanish! Not a good sign. There were also three TV's with three different things playing...At least they have China Mist tea. It is the only thing worth ordering, sorry to say.
