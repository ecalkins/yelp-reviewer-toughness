But two hours into our unlimted bowling our games were shut off and an employee rudely came into our area and started putting out bowling balls away.  No one knew what was going on because we were suppose to have unlimted bowling till close.  The managers said since they had a waiting list of people who purchased unlimted bowling that they ended our games.  

They were rude and kept trying to explain the small print of their unlimited bowling and would not listen to us explaining that it is false advertising to call it UNLIMITED bowling when there are limitations to it.  

I use to like this place but probably one of the worse customer experiences I have ever had.   This was a large group planned event and they could care less that they were losing he business of 16 people that all paid for unlimited bowling.  I will never say anything good about this place ever again and will tell everyone i know to never go there.  

Good job flipside you just lost my business."
