But tonight was a no-no our celery that comes with in the small ball with the ranch was disgusting I cannot believe they gave me nasty looking celery. Who looks at something that looks nasty and decide ""oh Its edible put it in a he bag""? I'm really upset with this kind of service I don't care if it's just celery it's something I'm paying for!!!!!"
