The manager had come over earlier and asked how things were and we told him our issues and how disappointed we were considering this was a special birthday dinner and he said he would make it right.  The bill came and not one item was discounted for the poor service.  Not even a free birthday desert.

We have been eating here with the kids for years.  That ended today.  Very disappointed with this restaurant.

Side note:  we ended up bringing all the dinner home because we ended up eating so much bread waiting for dinner to arrive."
