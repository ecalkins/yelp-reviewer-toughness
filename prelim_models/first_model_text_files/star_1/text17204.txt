I arrived around 12pm and like everyone else waited for about 45 minutes to get inside and place an order. 
While mixing of beef, pork, turkey etc is ok with most, I do not eat pork so seeing them use the same cutting board and knife and the same gloves to handle pork was enough for me to leave without eating. Even if I did eat pork I would certainly not want my beef to taste like pork or beef to taste like pork, or turkey to taste like either. 
It was unfortunate as I had heard quite a bit about their smoked brisket. 
Perhaps for the sake of including Jewish, Muslim, and those who do not eat pork customers , they should consider using separate cutting board and knives."
