I was standing in line waiting to be served and this lady - who CLEARLY saw me - just ignored me while she constantly glanced at me/my direction knowing that I was there waiting to be served. Havent you heard that you're supposed to take care of the line up/customers first before doing whatever it is you needed to do??? Clearly wasn't trained properly. Ended up walking away and ordering food somewhere else as she was taking too long and obviously her sweet time doing trivial things. Such a shame as my husband is a big fan of this place. Not anymore.
