The final straw was when I went in on a Sunday evening to order a simple teriyaki chicken bowl and was charged over $12! I asked why and was told the ""bowl"" is now a lunch menu item and dinner is a ""combo"" with a salad. When I got my to go order I had to ASK for the salad (after all I did pay an additional $6 for it). When I got home I saw that all the SMALL (4"" Ã— 4"" container)  salad is was only lettuce with lots of bad celery- I took two bites and threw it out! The chicken was also just blah.  So disappointed.  I won't be back."
