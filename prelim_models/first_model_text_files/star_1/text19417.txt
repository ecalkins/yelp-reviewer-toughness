When it was my turn to place my order I made sure to share with Hanna a couple of customer service tips. She was so embarrassed she had someone else give us our drinks. I wish I would have had the chance to talk to the manager about her behavior, but honestly I had more important things to do. Also, on Sunday when I went through the drive through they quickly told me what my total was without asking if there was anything else that I needed. ""I am not done yet! "" and then the guy laughed. Apparently everything you tell them is a joke. Also, last month they were out of venti cups..... I personally love Starbucks, but when it comes to customer service one bad experience it's all it takes to  lose the loyalty."
