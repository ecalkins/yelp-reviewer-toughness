Recently they hung a banner that proclaimed the new owner was back--well apparently the last owner took all the good knives. The lemon slice on my sashimi was completely dried out on one side, and the other side looked like it was sliced with a rough piece of cardboard. But reader--I ate anyway. :/ Aside from the preschool-level of knife skill, it tasted okay--not great, but I did sign on for discount sushi, ya know? All was okay until I got to the last piece of salmon sashimi, which looked like it had been stored in open air beside the lemon. It was slimy, disintegrating, and had the scariest whitish film on it that I could scrape off with my chopstick. 

I can already feel the shits coming on."
