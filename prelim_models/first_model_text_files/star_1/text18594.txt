I have an allergy to certain vegetables, and politely asked if they could be replaced with other vegetables at no charge. The waitress said yes. Upon receiving our receipt I was charged $1.00 per ingredient.  When I politely asked for an explanation from the waitress, Tim ran over with his chest puffed up like he was going to fist fight me and said,"" Everyone charges for replacing vegetables in food!"", I responded that in actuality, many restaurants exchange ingredients as a courtesy, especially for people with allergies. Tim then proclaimed,""I have never heard of that and I've been here for 3 years!"".  Despite his proclamations, I remained calm and said, ""I have lived near this location my entire life (34 years), and Oregano's Chicago Pizza across the street has always accommodated this request without an upcharge.""  He made yet another proclamation, ""I'm from Chicago!"".  I responded,""Well, I am not.""  He fired back,"" Well, let's get real, how many of you people are there here?"".  At this point, my wife and I could no longer put up with his lack of professionalism, and left the restaurant.  As a native to the Phoenix metro, I'm am aware that there are not many natives here compared to the mass of Chicagoans that have invaded, but I have not once taken issue with them and nor them me, until this visit to the Chicago-biased Butterfields.  I have definitely never been referred to as ""you people"" as a Phoenix native before.  This review is as perplexing to me as to why a restaurant manager from Chicago would move here to pick a fight with the entire native population to Phoenix."
