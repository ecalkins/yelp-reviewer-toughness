Very dry slices of chicken with a drizzle of thin teriyaki sauce and a large rice portion. It also came with ""salad"" on the same plate which consisted of lettuce and a few grated carrots with some sort of sweet tasting orange salad dressing (French)?
There was loud pop music blaring from speakers which didn't mesh with the restaurants' ambiance. 
To be fair, they had a lot of sushi choices which I didn't try. But, unfortunately I won't be returning."
