Not only did they not give us the full dozen of wings we paid for but their deep fried mushrooms were atrocious. How can you mess up deep fried mushrooms you ask? You'd have to ask Long Wongs because I thought it was impossible until today. They were soggy, the mushrooms tasted bad and the batter was somehow burnt and undercooked at the same time. Congrats Long Wongs, you literally made me spit out a deep fried mushroom, something I thought would never happen. As regulars here I can't imagine we'd be going back. I think I'd rather just spend a little extra at wing stop.
