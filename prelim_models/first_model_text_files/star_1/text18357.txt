A drink was spilled at the table and several of us took napkins from an adjoining table to wipe up the spill before a server could help us. The owner came over and reprimanded me for upsetting the table set up and wanted us to wait for a server to bring over extra napkins. He was very disrespectful and condescending to me when someone at out table called him out on this and asked if he could bring us more napkins he told our daughter to GET THE F___K OUT of his restaurant and he called the police on us. He was having a temper tantrum and his employees were apologizing for his behavior. I would not recommend going there to anyone ever. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. jm
