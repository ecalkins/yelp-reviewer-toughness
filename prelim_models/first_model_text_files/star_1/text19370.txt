So we said ok. Give out invitations and it just happened that one of our friend wanna get some info for the caf√© that they have and asked about their specials every Tuesday and get to find out FLIPSIDE management change everything including the Tuesday
deal that they have so now we have to change the plan and go to amazing jakes instead. Well its their loss."
