Tiny restaurant, 100 degrees inside, bland burger tonight,  but that's ok. What made me upset was horrible customer service.  The wobbly table got knocked, and my kindergartener's water bottle spilled (ever hear of cups with lids?) 
Well my husband said he would clean it up and then some old guy who worked there said ""shit"" and left to get a mop.  When I was returning from the bathroom wth my toddler, he just about ran her over in anger.  

I left without finishing.  I understand if your restaurant is tiny and you don't have adequate seating, but no need to have an attitude with your customers! 

I won't be returning."
