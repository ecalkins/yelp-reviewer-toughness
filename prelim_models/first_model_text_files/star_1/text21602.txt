If the idea of a burger loaded with different/non-traditional toppings is your perfect pick, then this place is for you. On the other hand, if you look for the best quality meat with real beefy bite, you won't find it here. This was our experience anyway. Burger = beef and I can't say a smooshed down patty satisfies."
