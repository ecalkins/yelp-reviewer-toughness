The reason I give this place a 1 star is due to a large cockroach scurrying across the dining room floor and the waitress non-chalantly scooping it up with her hand, disposing of it, then walking over to a table to fill some water glasses.  Did not even wash her hands.  That's it.  We're not coming back.
