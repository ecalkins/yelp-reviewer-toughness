The neighborhood is sketchy, the decor is gaudy, the atmosphere is a little rowdy and a little too casual.  The wings were severely burnt and very dry.  The BBQ sauce was extremely mediocre and a bit too sweet.  The pizza was just okay... At least it was recently cooked.  The employees seemed helpful and friendly though.  I can now say that I've been there and done that - - but I wish I couldn't."
