By the time I got to counter they were already out of several items. Maybe that's tolerable if you're part of the hipster cult that appears to the support the place but it's just BBQ.  There are literally dozens of other better more interesting places in Phoenix area.  If they provided refreshments or snacks or if they passed out numbers so you could do something productive maybe it would be better.  However as it stands now I'm done with this nonsense and I hope you are too.  Their indifference to the customer experience is simply inexcusable.
