I've eaten here a couple times and enjoyed the food quite a bit.  My wife's bun was very good, as was my girls' pho.  It was fun watching my 8 year old scooping noodles out of her soup with chopsticks, refusing to use a fork!

I had the chow mien and kung pao chicken.....at Panda!  My meal never showed up at Da Vang.  After asking about it 3 times, family completely done with theirs, we had to leave.  No apology, no empathy.  Just ""you don't want to wait?"" No, after nearly an hour for lunch with my food nowhere in site, no I don't want to wait.  Off we went to our next stop, with me at Panda while the girls shopped.  Ugh.  Oh yeah, while I was waiting, I heard the waiter tell the next table ""we're out of beef soup"". Really?"
