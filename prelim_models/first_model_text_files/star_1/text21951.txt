The customer service was good at first when I ordered but when I sat down the baristas were annoyingly gossiping loud enough for everyone to hear their entire conversation. The bathroom floor looked like it had never been mopped, there were wet paper towels all over the floor and the toilet was gross as well. The worst part about this Starbucks: FLIES EVERYWHERE!! Their trash can was completely full with flies hovering over it. I hardly write reviews but this was too disgusting not to. How can you ensure food safety when you have flies everywhere? BLEGH!!!!!!! My latte tasted fine but once I noticed the flies I no longer wanted to drink it.
