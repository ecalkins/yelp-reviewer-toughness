I have had wonderful experiences at both the Desert Ridge and Agua Fria locations.  45 minutes after we arrived my daughter received her entree.  5 minutes later, I told her to start eating.  The server said she would check on our meals.  15 minutes later, I saw what appeared to be one of the chefs talking with a patron at a nearby table.  The patron visibly upset.  I waved him over and he asked how our meals were.  I told him I wouldn't know, since we were missing two of them.  He did not apologize but simply said they were busy and he would check.  5 minutes later we received our meals which were terrible.  The pasta was hard, the sauce burnt and I'm almost certain had been run through the microwave. I will return to the two locations mentioned above but never, ever again to this location.
