Dear Customer Service Representative,

At the above mentioned date, time and location, myself and my wife visited the restaurant.  Our very poor experience started with the hostess stand which was manned by two, ""carefree children"" with no desire to conduct their duties or give an ounce of respect or greetings to customers.  Their pre-recorded wait time answer of ""we don't know"" was given to us and I was amused enough to take the pager and go wait with other patrons in line.  Total wait time 40+ minutes.

As we walked through the 3/4 full restaurant to the nearly empty patio we were seated in an area that had verifiably not been occupied for our entire wait time.

Drink order (no alcohol) took over 20 minutes to arrive and the food order was finally taken.  Basically, we were forgotten.  Also, not a single patio table had been bussed during our entire visit (approx. 2 hrs.)  As the food arrived after at least another 40 minutes there was no silverware, napkins or ordered sauces provided.  Our waitress went back to retrieve them and blamed the entire overwhelmingly unacceptable experience on the kitchen staff.  That's about the lowest one can go in the food service industry.

The reason I decided to write today is because EVERY time we come here, the service is extremely poor.  This is never the case at the Tempe location, which we love.

Thanks in advance for your attention in this matter"
