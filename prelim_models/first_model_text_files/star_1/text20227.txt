Every time I go there I run into issues but they don't care to tell me the issues until I come back to pick up my prescription. I waited 30 mins to come back and find out there was a computer error I was then told 15 more minutes to find out that they didn't have either of my prescriptions. What were they doing for 45 minutes?
