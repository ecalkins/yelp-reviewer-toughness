There is a single person cutting meat, who insists on putting everything back into a warmer after serving each customer.  If only they utilized their staff properly, and had multiple people preparing food (instead of standing around and managing the line)

The owner obviously thinks that forcing people to wait will make their barbecue taste better.  And based on these reviews, most people fall for it."
