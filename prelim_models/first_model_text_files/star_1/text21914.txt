You may judge me based on the fact I do not support local coffee houses, and that is all fine and dandy. But what I want every morning to start my day is great customer service and a consistently great product. Is this too much to ask? I certainly think not.

Occasionally I visit this Starbucks on my lazier mornings because they have a drive thru. I must say, the level of service, plainly stated, sucks here. They make my drink wrong every time and usually argue with me about it. Last time I checked, if I order something daily I know what is should look/taste like. Please just make it right the first time, and if you messed it up.....just say sorry with a smile and re-do it. Enough said. I will never be back to this location again, even on my lazy days. Having the convenience of a drive thru is not worth dealing with the nasty employees and slow service.

Now if you want a great Starbucks experience I would highly recommend the location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Every employee there has a great attitude and John the manager exemplifies consistently great service."
