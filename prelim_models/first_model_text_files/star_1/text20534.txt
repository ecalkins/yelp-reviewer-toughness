 the thick dust on the side of the booths and along the floor railing ( highlighted by the low evening sun streaming in the open door) The next thing we noticed was the food crumbs all over the floor.  I told the waitress we would not be staying because of the dirty condition of the restaurant. As we were leaving my husband said "" we should never have entered"" he had noted the unwashed windows as we were entering I shutter to think of the condition of the kitchen.  That's why few cars in the lot consistently.  To bad as we enjoy the chains restaurants as we travel.  Wheaton,il
Is our home base Marconi grill.   Kudos to that spotless well maintained restaurant."
