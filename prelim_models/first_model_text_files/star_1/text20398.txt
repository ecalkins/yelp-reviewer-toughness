We Sat out on the patio and no one even came out to greet us. After 15 minutes one of our guys went back inside and asked for service. One of the waitresses came out and had nothing but bad attitude. Then when we got our beers, another 20 mins later. They we're warm. Then when I asked for another beer she told me "" Put it outside for a little while"". The manager had to come out and bring me a new beer. 
I love Hooters. I eat at every Hooters in every city that I visit. I've never had service this bad in my life. I will never visit this location again. I wish you could give them -5."
