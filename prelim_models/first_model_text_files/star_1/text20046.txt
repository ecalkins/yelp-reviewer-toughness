Everything LOOKED delicious but the food was cold and 2 bites in I found a hair in my orange chicken. We told the lady that initially sat us down and she said ""I'm sorry do you still want to eat or leave?"" Why would we want to stay? We lost our appetite at that point. On our way out she went straight to the kitchen and was yelling at the kitchen staff. We will never return here."
