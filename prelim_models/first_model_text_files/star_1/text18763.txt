Watched as the helpers would dry dishes with dirty rags, and the bus boy would clean dirty dishes, then immediately serve with dirty hands. I'm not a germaphobe, but this took the cake... Did I also mention that for our group, they forgot not only one, two, but three entrees? and only after we notified them twice did they acknowledge food was missing?

Terrible. Never again. If you want cheap pho, but horrible dirty service... come on in."
