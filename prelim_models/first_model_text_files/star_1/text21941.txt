When you pay over 5 dollars for a coffee, it should be perfect and taste the same no matter which Starbucks or the time of day. The Barista also was frowning and lacking motivation when making the coffee.  You could taste his personality in the way the coffee tastes. Next time I will go to the one on Mountain View Starbucks.
