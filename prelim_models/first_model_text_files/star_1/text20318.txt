I got a cup to get water but then juice came out. My dad told the cashier who answered ""oh we don't have any more water."" wow.  We get to our table and we didn't need to wait awhile for our eel sushi which was mostly just rice. My dad received his curry  rice....Worst presentation and not appealing. My sister's order comes and the waiter's fingers were black and dirty was touching her rice and tempura. I asked him if they had new management and he said it's been a month. So that explained it. I feel bad for the owner.. I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant closed down.  It is so obvious that the employees hate their jobs. Nobody smiled except one lady. They were rude and just looked real unhappy. I saw the cashier talking down to the Japanese cook. Anyway so they close at 8pm today and a couple comes. I asked if they were the owner and they weren't. I told them it was because if they were I wanted to tell them about our experience. So anyway after 15mins, the lady stands up and says she didn't get the right order, that her dish tasted like they put vinegar in it and that  they forgot her order and when she asked about it the cashier said it was because they came in late. She ended up asking for a refund. I am never coming back to this restaurant ever again."
