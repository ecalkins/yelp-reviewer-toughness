This was possibly the worst Indian buffet I've ever been to.  We went for lunch on a Monday at 1:30 pm, so not an unusual lunch time.  Everything on the buffet looked like it had been sitting there for a *long* time.  We probably should have walked out as soon as we saw the steam table, but we were hungry and on a time limit, so we stayed.  The tray of dal had solidified into a lentil crust.  The rice was tough, chewy and crunchy.  There was hardly any chicken in the tray of butter chicken - I had to dig through the sauce to find just 3 pieces of chicken.  The other dishes also looked like they had been sitting there for hours.

As for the taste - pakoras were actually pretty good.  Butter chicken tasted overwhelmingly of ketchup.  Mattar paneer had no flavour at all.  Beef rogan josh was similarly unremarkable.  They bring the nan out from the kitchen rather than having it out on the steam table, so I had hoped that it would at least be fresh.  Alas, no. It also tasted like it had been sitting out being kept warm.  (Though it wasn't too bad - not like the ancient rice. The nan was probably the best part of the meal.)

We sat and waited for a while to see if they would replace some of the old dishes on the table.  Not one was changed while we were there.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking serving that food to people.  I don't know what I was thinking to eat it.  

On the plus side, our waiter was friendly and efficient.  Our water was refilled when asked, and we were seated quickly and with a smile."
