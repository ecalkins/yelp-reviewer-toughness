My mom and dad suckered me into meeting them here and it's kind of awful and agreeably Americanized Chinese food. My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*.

Everything tasted totally ""off""... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my ""check engine"" light on immediately).


*This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with. They are now Bush-loving Republicans, and I am... okay with this. Breathe, Norma."
