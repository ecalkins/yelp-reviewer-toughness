Prices are up, quantity is down and quality is down.  We could not taste (or see) any dressing on our Caesar salads, and the price was higher.  We were surprised by the menu prices; $11 for a small portion of pasta plus $5 for a meat topping.  We could have gone to a fancier place for that.  And $11 bucks for a small so-so pizza.  Our food did not arrive all at once and we were told that they could not cook moe than one pizza at a time.  Really?  Best to move on; things have gone south.  When they can no longer afford to offer mints on the way out, you know they have problems.  I would not have given even one star, but I had to click something to move on.
