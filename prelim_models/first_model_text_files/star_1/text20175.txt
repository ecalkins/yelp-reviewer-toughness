Perhaps Damian, the head of the meat department, or Lucy, the store director, or Corporate has decided cutting corners is more important than treating employees and clients well?  I like to know what I am serving to family and friends and you can't do that here.  

Produce is as good or better at Sprouts, as is the sushi....and at a much better value.  Dairy and dry and canned goods are the same or cheaper at Costco.  Trader Joes has better niche products.  AJs has better meat.  And the butcher department at Safeway is happy to accommodate a simple request from a client.

The staff at the store is great but my buying power is going elsewhere because your value proposition just changed."
