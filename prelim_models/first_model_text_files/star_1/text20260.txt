The food has gone down hill and tastes extremely cheap! The food I had tasted like rubber! Half the things you ask about on the menu the server doesn't even know and what I was served didn't even come with what the menu said and had to order it. I used to really like this place but cannot get that smell out of head! I will not go back.
