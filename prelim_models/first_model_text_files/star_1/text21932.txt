0	The WORST Starbucks I have ever been to. Currently been waiting at the drive thru window for over five minutes and no one has even greeted me. I go out of my way to go to the other Starbucks in McCormick Ranch to avoid this one. Still typing and and still haven't seen a person. The reviews don't lie. This store is poorly managed and the service is ALWAYS well below Starbucks overall service standards. Still no drink...  This has been an issue for well over two years.
