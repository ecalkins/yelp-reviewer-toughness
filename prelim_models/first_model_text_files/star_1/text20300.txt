We ordered our standard order of teriyaki chicken and yakiniku beef. Our cost increased 50% and our food was terrible. You can tell they are trying to save money and skimping everywhere. I'd suggest to stop buying printer ink and go back to the old ingredients. Majorly disappointed as the old Eastwind was delicious. Bummed.
