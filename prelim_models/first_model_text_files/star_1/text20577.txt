Will waiting for our seat, I noticed the women at the To Go stand checking her phone.  Waited about 20 minutes and was seated.  Noticed a whole section that the tables were empty.  Ordered our meal.  My husband and I ordered a Caesar salad with no Caesar dressing and balsamic vinegar on the side. When salads came we received a different salad. Didn't say anything, we just ate it.  We all order whole wheat pasta.  They all came out hard.  Mine was clumpy like you didn't cook it for very long.  Told the waitress and she said that is how they have to cook whole wheat pasta so it won't be mush.  She asked if we wanted another pasta and I asked for regular pasta.  Mine came with my meal.  My son didn't finish his pasta.  My husband, son, and I ordered sausage.  Will I was tasting my pasta, my son ate a piece of the sausage. He looked at the other piece and asked if it was raw.  Clearly it was raw in the middle. I cut mine open and mine was raw.  My husbands was a little pink.  My son asked to see a manager.  In the mean time, the waitress came back and asked if everything was alright.  We showed her the sausage, she apologized and took one plate.  The chef came out and apologized and offered something else.  He offered us shrimp.  We ordered that and also noticed my son did not finish his pasta.  Offered to make another.  We received the shrimp and it was over cooked.  When we received our bill, one dinner was removed.  We paid for our dinner and left.  The manager was at the front door and said good night.  In all my life, I have never returned a meal.  I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again.
