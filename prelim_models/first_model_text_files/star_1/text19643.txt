The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone. 

As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza.  Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money.

The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations.
Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food.


I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good."
