The laser tag and Laser maze is nicer than some other places. We had an issue with availability of one of the attractions and owner was really grumpy to give us a $5 credit for it! Not sure if we are going back.

Update on 5/27. Ended up going back due to a b'day. The cafe staff was pretty rude. It seems like the customer is always wrong here. Downgrading the rating from 2 star to 1 !!"
