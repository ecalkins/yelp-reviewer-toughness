They cut it in half for me but when we opened it, there were tiny ants crawling out of the noodles!  I proceeded to contact the food inspection authorities and found other complaints on their website from the general public.  I can't believe I had been eating here for the last 10+ years even when they had no AC (one summer) or would sometime run out of the dish that I ordered!  I'm Vietnamese so I have gone to plenty of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and they were great and so was Da Vang until my incident and reading those other complaints.  My appetite is gone for them.
