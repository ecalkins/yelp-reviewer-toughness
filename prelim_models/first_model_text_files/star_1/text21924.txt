It was taking awhile and I said as much to my son sitting with me in the car. Well ...BEWARE apparently they can eavesdrop and hear everything you say. The girl working chimed in to tell me they had a big order. Then when I got to the window she gave me the total, rang it up, handed me back my card then turned her back and walked away. No receipt, no thank you. Happy Friday to you too!
