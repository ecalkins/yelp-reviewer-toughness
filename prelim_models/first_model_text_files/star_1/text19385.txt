Their web site said it was open 10am-7pm today. We showed up before 6:00pm. The doors were locked and there was no sign saying it was closing early. Needless to say, the kids were very disappointed. We also noticed others trying to go in as well, surprised by the locked doors. We also had bad customer service the last time we went with a large group. Flipside could be a great venue, if it were run by folks interested in the customers.
