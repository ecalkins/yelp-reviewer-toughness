As for the meal, no matter what was ordered by the 7 of us having dinner, every dish had the consistency of mush and the red sauce was identical. In fact, I think they had my mother's recipe which used Heinz Ketchup as the base. I will say our waiter was very nice and attentive and another waiter who sang happy birthday had a truly wonderful voice, but even that couldn't make up for the un-hot lava cake with Hershey syrupy poured over it. With all the great Italian places in the greater Scottsdale area, it's easy to avoid this one.
