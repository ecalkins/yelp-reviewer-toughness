0	One star only because I was with family. Long wait for food, forgot my iced tea you're almost 20 minutes, food was edible solely because I was starving. To top it off the  2 portions of chicken parmigiana for myself and 16 year old son were more of a childrens portion with chicken medallions instead off a patty. This along with an $11 penne with butter and parmigiana came to a ridiculous $50. Never again will I waste time and another cent at this chain.
