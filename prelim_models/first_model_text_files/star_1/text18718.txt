After waiting 20 min to get seated, took us another 15 min to order our food then another 25 minutes to get our food! We ordered appetizers and it came out after we were halfway done eating. My group ordered pho and we had to ask for spoons 3 different times and anytime I asked for something, they ignored me, looked irritated and walked away. I understand if they are busy but don't treat people that way. I lost my patience with the 4 different people that came to our table. None of them were on the same page. We ordered the extra big bowl of pho and it barely had any meat in it. They might as well call it extra big bowl of noodles. I will never come back here again! It was ridiculous.
