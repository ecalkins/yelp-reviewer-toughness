I guess the crab stick had plastic that the chef did not remove and then he made the roll and there was plastic surrounding each piece of crab with it. The server did not really care apologized and asked if we wanted another that we obviously did not! There may have been a manager there but was unsure as no one of authority came to talk to use about what happened. I am very disappointed about the lack of professionalism with this place. You fed my family plastic!!!! No apology. I am never eating here again!!!!!!!
