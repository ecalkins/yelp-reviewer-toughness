I sat down with my plate and began to feel sick. When we brought up the issue to them, they didn't seem to care. They just wanted money! Way overpriced and food was cold. Tried  acknowledging them on how the kitchen staff should know about the product they are serving. The waiter that we had talked about how the owner was there, when our issue was brought up the owner denied being the owner and didn't want any part of our conversation. All we wanted is to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else. A awful place!!
