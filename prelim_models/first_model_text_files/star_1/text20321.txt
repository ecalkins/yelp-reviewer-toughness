The Manager Jung, was extremely rude and not at all helpful. This place changed ownership a few months ago which means smaller portions for more money. Sue was the ONLY saving grace of this place. I will not return to location as well, I will advise friends and family to do the same. The regular bowl for Teryaki Chicken used to fill me up with left overs for approximately $8.10. Now the ""plate"" is 10.00. Imagine only 6 medium sized strips of chicken with 2 huge scoops of rice. Fill half of the plate with the salad and thousand island dressing and the other ""half"" with rice and chicken. The food quality tasted the same but amounts were different. I requested why this change took place and the manager Jung said ""Eastwind has ALWAYS served on plated with half salad and have ALWAYS charged $10.00"" Not only was I upset about the amount of food for the price, I was now extremely upset at the tone and way Jung spoke to my family and me. I do not recommend this location any longer but should you go... Ask for Sue. She is a sweetheart older woman that ordered me another bowl to say sorry for the way her family member Jung treated my family during this visit. We came from Anthem and feel this just is not worth the drive any longer. Steer clear folks if you were a regular at some point... not at all the same."
