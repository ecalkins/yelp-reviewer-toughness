I spent countless hours and dollars here working on my bachelor's and master's degrees. They had this awesome giant conference table where you plug in and spread out your books and papers. They had good lighting for studying and coloring. And over Labor Day weekend, they destroyed all of it. Gone is the giant table with the good lighting. I no longer have any reason to return. Shame on you, Starbucks, for making your stores as uncomfortable as possible. I guess quantity served is more important than the quality of the customers' experiences.
