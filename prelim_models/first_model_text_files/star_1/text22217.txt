The first time we came during a dinner rush so we let it go, as our server seemed kind of new.  But we sat for over an hour waiting for our food while people were seated, ate, and left around us.   When we finally said something our food was delivered within a few minutes - cold.   Today we thought 'it's the middle of the afternoon, surely it will be fine'.  Nope.  Got seated and waited and waited.   Food came 25 minutes later, wrong order.   When we asked the waitress about it she said we had called the item by the 'tailgater' appetizer rather than the 'tablegater' appetizer, so she gave us the 'house appetizer' (???????).  We've been to other locations.  They're fine.  But, never going back again to this one.
