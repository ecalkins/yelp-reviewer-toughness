No big deal, right?  Well, after about 30 minutes, the woman in line just ahead of me was told that they did not have her order that was phoned in about an hour earlier.  So, she placed another order and sat down to wait.  

Finally, after about 45 minutes in line, I make it to the cashier, and after giving him my name and what was ordered, he proceeds to tell me that they do not have the order!  Thinking that my name could have been mis-spelled or taken down incorrectly, I asked him if there was an identical order under a similar name.  Instead of checking, the employee looks at me and asks, ""Are you asking me to give you someone else's food?""  Unbelievable!  Then he asks me if I want to place an order to go!  After witnessing what was happening in the kitchen during my 45 minute wait, I'm sure that I would have had another hour or more to wait for my order to be completed!  The kitchen that was utterly chaotic.  Absolutely no organization by the chef (who was shouting out orders to anyone who would listen, but no one in particular)!  The kitchen was piled high with dirty pans everywhere.  It's a wonder they got any orders out.  

Had the cashier not accused me of asking him to give me another person's food, I may have considered returning to this restaurant.  However, after that treatment, and what I witnessed in the kitchen, I can say with confidence that I will NEVER set foot in this place again!"
