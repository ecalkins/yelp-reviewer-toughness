I love Pho and so I looked this place up in a Google search for top 10 pho places in Phoenix. This was a meet up lunch with my girlfriend and her toddler. Myself and my toddler arrived a little earlier we got a table, and I asked for a high chair. They brought the highchair (dirty with grime and sticky stuff all over) no big deal, I had disinfectant wipes. I cleaned it up and sat my kid in it. As I sat down myself, I realized my chair was wet. I immediately stood up and noticed there was a yellow urine like puddle under the table. I told the waiter staff and they just replaced my chair, claiming it was just water spilled. It def smelled bad and it was not water. Whatevs, I went into the restroom and wiped off whatever it was with soap off the back of my jeans. My girlfriend and her kid arrived so they asked for another highchair. Another dirty highchair was brought. I handed her the wipes and she did her thing. We ordered our food, which took a little while Pho Ga (chicken pho) and a sandwich for our kids to split. I tasted my Pho and it was descent, however before I could take a 2nd sip we looked over on the wall by our table and saw a cockroach just passing by like we were in his territory. This is when we got up and walked to the cashier and told them what's up. They thought we were lying or something. I walked them over and pointed at the cockroach. At this point they just started cleaning up the table and muttering something under their breath. That's cool. I walked back to the cashier and his response was ""Don't worry it's on me""  .....I paused with silence and had to make sure there were no one jumping out with cameras telling me I was on an episode of some sort of disgusting restaurant joke. The most horrible restaurant experience ever."
