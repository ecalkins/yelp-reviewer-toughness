The crawfish was terrible,and both Wife and i said ""hope I dont get sick from the warm oysters, the young manager was wearing a flat brimmed baseball cap,when he came to the table. This place has changed hands within the last three years,and should be straightened out before it goes the way of others of the same nature,and no crab legs on a sunday mid -afternoon? On the hunt again for a good quality Seafood buffet,Phx/Sctsdale area. Sorry to see this one ruined."
