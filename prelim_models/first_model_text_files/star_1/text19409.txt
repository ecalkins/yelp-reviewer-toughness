My drink order has been wrong on too many occasions to count and as someone who primarily uses the drive-through, I am often not realizing their mistake until I am home. I have been given drinks that I did not order (obviously they mistakenly gave me someone else's order), had to repeat my order multiple times for them to only then get it wrong, and am repeatedly given regular milk when I have requested soy. It is unfortunate that this Starbucks is in my neighborhood and the closest to my home because it is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.
