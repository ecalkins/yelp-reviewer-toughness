Service: prompt and friendly. Beer cold and the best thing about the place. 
Decor/Ambience: like the TV section of Walmart + beer. 
Ugly,  uncomfortable wood/metal chairs, formica tables. The front room has carpet flooring, which always skeeves me out at a restaurant. Lots of big TV's, showing lots of sports. 
Food: Blah.  I ordered some sort of salad with chicken; was dismal. OK so maybe you shouldn't order a salad at a sports bar; that thought did cross my mind.
But my BF ordered their ""specialty combo"" which is basically wings and fries. He said it was terrible. Fries were cold and hard, the slaw was MIA, wings were depressing. Nothing we ate was worthwhile. Prices aren't even good.  Would have gotten higher quality food from almost any fast food chain."
