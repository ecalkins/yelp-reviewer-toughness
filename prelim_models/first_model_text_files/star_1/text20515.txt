We have dined at MG in different parts of the country but probably been to this particular location 10 times. We visited Sunday and it will be our LAST. We went for early dinner (4PM) so there was no one there. Our party was 2 adults, 2 kids. We ordered meals and dinner salads. After ordering, we waited 20 minutes before I got up to ask if the waitress could bring our salads. We could see her going from the kitchen to the bar but never back in the dining room. Here response when I walked to the bar was ""the chef is working on them""... it was another 8-10 minutes before we had salads. About 10 minutes later, the waitress brought 1 kids meal - burnt to a crisp chicken fingers that looked like they should not have been served. SO one of our kids was served while the other waited... and waited and waited. Then he got his spaghetti. Another 10 minutes passed and we got our meals. The food was ok but the whole experience was so poor we just wanted out. It took 90 minutes to eat with two 9-yr old boys. We had no drinks, aps or dessert - that is crazy. Never going back!"
