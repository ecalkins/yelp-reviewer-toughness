I was full that time and didn't get the chance to try the kulfi (iced-milk dessert) though, and ever since I travelling India, I've been on the search for authentic pistachio kulfi. 

This time I went after a volunteer shift around the area, and being a cold winter night, I felt like a nice cup of hot chai and wanted to try the kulfi. My partner and I were seated and served poppers and we ordered chai and kulfi. They gave us a weird look. Ok... anyway, the chai reminded me of India, but could use more cinnamon and cardamom. The kulfi was actually not half bad, and had a decent amount of pistachios, but felt a bit freezer burnt. I considered ordering more food but I had already eaten earlier, so decided not to this time. When we asked to get the bill, we were unkindly told they don't serve just tea and dessert without ordering a full meal. Ha. Really? We felt extremely unwelcome and discriminated towards. Perhaps the way we were dressed? How much they thought we could pay? I don't know what business model they run under, but as far as I am concerned, business is business and should be happy for any business. Don't judge a book by its covers, I don't have to show you what I do for a living, let alone justify what I order? Well, it doesn't matter anymore! 

Too bad, the food was OK and I was considering making a reservation for a group of friends this weekend, but with the bad attitude and hence extremely poor service, you have lost our business... wait for it... FOREVER. I'll be sure to spread the word with my buddies, so too bad for you!"
