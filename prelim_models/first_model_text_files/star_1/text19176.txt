As I turned to look around the restaurant I noticed how filthy the blinds were, splattered with some kind of beverage. Oh and how could I forget the roach behind me on the wall. Now, I know a lot of restaurants have them, but the last thing you want to see is 1 while you are eating. Commmon! 
Please don't invite me again!!!"
