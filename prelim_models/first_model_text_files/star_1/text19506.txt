They got my burger wrong (I had to repeat me order a dozen times, still wrong), waited longer than necessary to be helped at the counter, and the burger they replaced mine with was not fresh. The meat wasn't very warm, the sauce was soaked in the bun like it was put on a while before, cheese was hardly melted, and hardly any lettuce. It's like they gave me a burger that was made 15 min prior, slapped some mustard on it and called it good.
