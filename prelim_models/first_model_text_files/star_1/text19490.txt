We order a a number one plain with animal fries, a number one no onions, and a number two with onions. The cashier rung up our order as animal style burgers, and plain fries which you really could tell it was rung up incorrectly until the food arrived. My colleague went to the register to let them know we didn't our animal fries that we ordered. He quickly asked to see the receipt so she came back to get the receipt. He told her you didn't pay for it. And he didn't return the receipt.  She came back to the table saying that we didn't order it.  And I Told her I did. So I went to the register to tell the gentleman the situation and before I could open my mouth he tell me we didnt pay for it. So First I asked for my receipt back. And I told him are whole order was messes up. Then he shows me they the burgers were animal style which we did not order that way. And I told hime I did order animal fries. He asked me if I wanted them I said yes. So he had a different cashier ring me up for them. The nice lady did apologize for the error. So I paid for the order of animal fries and she said she would bring them to the table. The same guy who was a little combative came to the table and said he needed to take the plain fries and the would  the animal fries out. Animal fries were brought out and we began to eat our now Luke warm food. After reviewing the receipt in detail, I paid for 3 combos and an order of animal fries, so I don't understand why he took the fries back. The end experience is that I was treated rudely, overcharged, and had lukewarm messed up order. Not happy at all.
