This would all be bearable if it wasn't for the completely awful service. It was painfully slow and they brought out one dish at a time, so everyone had to wait to eat and the food was cold. We asked for the bill 3 times the third time the waiter laughed in our faces. Very rude. The food was fine but definitely not worth the terrible experience.
