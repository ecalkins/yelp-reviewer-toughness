We even called them to make sure they have those seafoods like crab legs, oysters, sashimi etc that are only available during dinner time. To our disappointment , they were all present but they were NOT FRESH. We were so afraid to even touch them. Discolored sashimi, dried out oysters, low quality crab legs and even the sushi are left overs from we don't know when. On the hot buffet spread table , the food are all dried up. We are willing to pay $22.00 per person for dinner time as long as it is worth it. It doesn't have to be extra ordinary but we demand that the FOOD BE FRESH. Hope they do something about it.
