The butter chicken was cold within seconds, the paneer was too spinach-y. This isn't even to mention the super small portions. $15 for a portion of butter chicken the size of your fist? $5 for TWO pieces of Naan? A handful of rice? I would not recommend this place unless you like to throw money away.
