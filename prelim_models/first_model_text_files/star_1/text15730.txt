I don't care how long the lines are, which might make you believe this is a good place, It's Not. 

The food was horrible and somewhat expensive. If you must stand in a long line, then go to Tim Horton's right next door (see photo).

The burger was sooo over cooked I thought I was in the UK (Sorry)!  The foot long hot dog was unimaginable at best. Their bacon & cheese came with a folded piece of Velveeta and one slice of burnt bacon. Ugh!  Don't!  

My stomach was regurgitating on our entire trip to Dublin, et cetera.  The old UK Wimpy was miles better than this place and that's saying something. 

Yelp friends, don't let other Yelp friends eat here!"
