This Starbucks had been this bad for years....years.   Trying to give it a 2nd chance the last time i was there my iced drink had an inch and a half of nothing at the top.   A month prior the drive thru lady told me my breakfast item had fell on the counter, didn't touch anything and was ok proceeding to hand it to me.
