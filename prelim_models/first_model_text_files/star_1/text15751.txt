If it is possible to be more stressed out ordering a burger than being frisked by U.S customs, something is very wrong. 

Let me save you some trouble. If you are wandering in Pearson airport in the near region of gate F66 and thinking of giving this place a try- DON'T. 

No organization, no regard for time, no respect for patrons, no apparent management in effect, no-good burger, no way do you get my money again. 

We were several people waiting to be served when they started closing up shop literally on us (their gate scraped my boot). Then we order and are treated to a show as we wait: staff fighting in plain sight. The main culprit was yelling incessantly at a cashier. She bore the name tag Satnam, but it might as well have read Satan (and the gate next door F666) as far as I'm concerned. Other staff members were putting away the drinks in the vending machine and putting up tables with people waiting to be served. And the grill- empty. We had to shout our orders (over the screaming Satnam) to finally get served. Mayhem.  

Final verdict- burger tasted like crap and I was accidentally given someone else's stale fries (I know I didn't order them so... Someone is going hungry somewhere).

I RECOMMEND: walking past this train wreck, unless you are stopping by with a squat team to rescue the cashier getting abused in there.

Just. Don't. Do it. To. Yourself."
