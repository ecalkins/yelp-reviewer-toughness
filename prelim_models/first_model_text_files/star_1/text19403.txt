I have on two occasions in the past month spoken to the manager about it - I think his name is John - about the grumpy people that work there.  On the phone he promised me a free drink the next time I was in (which he conveniently forgot when I asked him about it).

The first few times I was in I was waited on by a young lady who never smiled (actually it was more of a scowl) and when I interacted with her she was blank faced and sour in her reactions.  This was the person I spoke to the manager about.  

Today I was served by a young lady who basically threw my drink at me (energetically) and when I asked for extra ice she scowled at me.  Never said thanks, smiled or offered any pleasantries.

Basically the service in that store s*&ks.  I have been in there multiple times and have never really gotten anything close to what I would call happy service.

Thought you should know.  Unfortunately I will not be going into that store again.
