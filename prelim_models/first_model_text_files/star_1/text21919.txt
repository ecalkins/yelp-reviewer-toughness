The last few months however, my schedule has changed and I go in the morning. I usually wait 20 minutes in the drive through, and get my usual iced caramel macchiato. It's always missing something. Tastes awful. After my drive through today, I have had enough. I went to the Starbucks on Shea and they returned my drink and made it correctly for me. This has been about the 10th time this has happened. $60 worth of coffee, now I'm a little upset. I guess I'll start making the drive to Shea
