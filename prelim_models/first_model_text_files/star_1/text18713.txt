0	The restaurant is infested with roaches! At my table a roach crawled up when I told a waiter he killed it and walked away without giving an apology. We then told the manager he said they sprayed but couldn't get rid of all of them! Even before we saw the roach the food was disgusting. Please do not go to this location this is not sanitary.
