The young waiter took my order who has bad English; he talks to much and try to say some funny things. And then, after taking my order he got his phone out and keep texting. Stop waste my time. I just have 30 minutes for my lunch. The service always takes so long. I don't have time to waste at all. Absolutely, I will never be back!!!"
