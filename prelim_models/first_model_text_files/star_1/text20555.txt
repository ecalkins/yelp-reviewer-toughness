Still the same as it was last year.  Initially I was going to give this 2 stars for the bad service, but then our food arrived.

Service was slow. Extremely slow.  We were there at 2:00 PM and the place was a ghost town.  We had to wait 10 minutes before any of the employees would acknowledge we were even in the establishment.  Took another 5 minutes to seat our party of 3 at a booth.  They seated us right next to the restroom when the rest of the restaurant was open and available.

Our table was set for two, but they said they would bring another place setting.  Eventually our waiter showed up to take our drinks - I got a feeling of resentment from him, kind of like he'd rather be anywhere but here (that feeling was mutual).  When we didn't want any wine he got a little miffed.

The food came out cold and nasty.  The water bottles that they use to pour water from were filthy - INSIDE THE BOTTLE!!!

Seriously...  This place is right in the heart of Scottsdale.  There are probably 100 to 200 restaurants with in a 1 mile radius.  Any one of them is a better choice than here.  Scottsdale has some PHENOMENAL eateries, don't waste your time at Romano's Macaroni Grill."
