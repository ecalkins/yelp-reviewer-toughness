I was in Jasmine Tokyo last Friday (june 26, 2015) for their dinner service. i started my meal at the sushi area. The sashimi did not look fresh and the roll I ate had spoiled rice. I thought it was just the spicy mayo that tasted off. Even my wife immediately knew it was spoiled and did not touch her rolls. 

That roll gave me the worst stomach flu ever!"
