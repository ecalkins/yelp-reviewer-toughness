Looking for a small meal, we ordered three rolls: spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, and a Philly roll. 
The spicy tuna was passable, but the oiliness and lack of freshness of the spicy yellowtail was appalling. The color if the yellowtail was darker than I had ever seen before. The salmon in the Philly roll was drab and lacked freshness/flavor. 
There is no alcohol available at the moment, so you are well advised to head to the supermarket for sushi and Japanese beer for a better experience. 
From an ambiance perspective, the place seemed dingier than I had remembered, with a two story ladder visible to many of the diners. 
Eastwind used to represent decent sushi and fish/veggies/rice at a reasonable price. It no longer delivers that level of value."
