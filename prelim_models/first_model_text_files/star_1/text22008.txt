The servers were more occupied at their stations on their phones! When we inquired we were told that they had to help them close out a large party!!!! It was bullshit cause they werent more than 6 people!!!! At first they seemed to be swarmed but when you saw the amount of people, that wasnt possible!! Last time we will be here! Our group is usually 12, and believe me we would give ya business! Not at Ditkas!!
