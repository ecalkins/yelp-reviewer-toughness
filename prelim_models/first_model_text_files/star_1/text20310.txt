The girl didnt seem to want to be bothered and said to sit wherever. We sat down and a gentleman wiped our dirty table off for us which was already set with chopsticks and napkins. The rag he used to wupe the table was sopping wet, and he lifted each napkin up setting them back down on the table. They all wound up soaked because he did not dry the table with a dry rag. So gross. Then we waited 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. They were not busy. We left!
