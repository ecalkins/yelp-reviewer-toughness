So I get my food, took one bite and delicious, second bite, and I felt something that wasn't burger. I ended up pulling out a foot long hair, and I have a shaved head. I was absolutely disgusted. I took my food back in and the guy was like ""oh well that sucks, I can make you another one"" no apology, no offer to refund my money back. So they make me another burger, and the guy comes out and says ""man that sucks, this is rare, the last time this happened was like two months ago."" Two months!!! What!! And then he proceeds to say ""well I mean you guys know hair is floating in the air, so that hair could have come from anywhere."" Zero accountability, zero customer service. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I sincerely hope they read this and fix their business."
