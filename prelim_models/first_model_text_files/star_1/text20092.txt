Another thing can they guarantee that these animals DON'T have flees, DOdo have all their shots up to date, WON'T get scared and bite me or some other unsuspecting shopper?  And what about the little ""presents"" they may leave behind???  Don't want THOSE near food I might want to EAT!  Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen to me."
