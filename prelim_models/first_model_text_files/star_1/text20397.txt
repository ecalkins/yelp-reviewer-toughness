Finally ordered beverages and my drink was wrong.  The bar top where we were sitting was dirty and asked to have it wiped clean of the leftover food and crumbs from the previous patrons.  The waitress working behind the bar was by herself with about 10 customers.  We were ignored having to get her attention for another beverage and order food.  The three to four other waitresses were working tables with three couples only and no help at the bar was offered.  The manager didn't help but wanted to interrupt the bar waitress to show him how she cut limes?  The service was deplorable, the food marginal, and the restaurant was dirty.  The cook was eating food in the kitchen with his bare hands while preparing orders!   Will never frequent the restaurant or any Hooters.  The worst!
