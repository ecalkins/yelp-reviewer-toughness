We had finished our first full game before our server finally brought us pitcher of water(we had to track him down 3 times to repeatedly ask), waited over an hour for our appetizers, however, our beer came out within a mere 40 minutes... Won't ever be going back! It's such a shame, we had high hopes for this place since there's really nothing like it on this side of town. :-(
