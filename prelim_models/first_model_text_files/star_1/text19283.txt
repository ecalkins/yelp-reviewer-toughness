From lack of experience, lack of leadership, lack of basic customer service skills, malfunctioning/non functioning equipment (game machine and laser tag gun), we tried our best to have a nice family evening with our group of 13 (children and adults).
This place is so shady. The management and workers deceive patrons. They not only made us wait about an hour while we called ahead and were told to come between 9-9:30, they then put us on an fake waiting list,  and conveniently made us wait until the rates changed.  Whether someone spends $1 or close to $300 like we did, and whether a child has an issue or an adult, Mr. Manager of the evening, you epically failed. Your incompetence is reflected consistently throughout this establishment."
