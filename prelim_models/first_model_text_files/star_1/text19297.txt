I asked several times if it covered everything and all times I was told yes. Well my boys went to use the game cards for the arcade games and they did not work. Went back to the cashier only now to be told that the everything pass does not include the arcade games. I said that the other cashier told me that it was for everything to only to be told ""sorry for the confusion"" and that I needed to purchase a seperate card to play the arcade games. ""Really"", I dont think so. We will not be back..."
