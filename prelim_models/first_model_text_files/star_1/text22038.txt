It is a great place, wonderfully formal but comfortable atmosphere, and when you take a bite of your steak you understand why you paid $50 just for the meat. Sadly, none of this applies to Ditka's out here in Phoenix. The fact that it is in a casino isn't terrible. But it is only a glass wall separating you and the slot machines eating pensioners life savings. It does nothing to block out the noise either. Then you have servers with spiked hair and large ear gauges. That's fine if I'm at an Applebee's, but not a supposedly formal steakhouse. The ""formal"" part of this is completely wiped out by the lack of any dress code. No requirement for at least a button up shirt. I had the pleasure of a large man in a very dirty jersey sitting at the table next to me. But all this pails in the quality of the steak. Just like Chicago you are paying $50+ just for a steak so you know it has to be good, right? Wrong. My girlfriend and I had to refuse these dry, grissly, flavorless hunks of roadkill. These ""things"" made a Denny's t-bone taste like Aphrodite herself was pouring ambrosia down your throat. Heartbroken is the most appropriate description I can give. The best steak I have ever had was at Ditka's in Oakbrook, IL. The worst was at Ditka's in Laveen, AZ."
