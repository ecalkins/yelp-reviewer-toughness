We went for brunch and were told ""move away from the reception desk,"" I countered with ""where should we stand as there's a huge crowd sitting and standing in the waiting area."" The manager got rude, nasty and abusive saying that I should ""be quiet or I'll throw you out."" When I complained to another manager he said we had just met the owner and although he's heard the same  complaints before there was nothing he could do. WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! Why give your money to such a rude owner? There's too many other great places in town!"
