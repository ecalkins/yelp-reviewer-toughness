You HAVE TO wait for your drinks first and only after you are allowed to order your food. Also you never know how long your drink order will take. 
Manager explained me why they have such a policy. All to convince the kitchen, not the customers. 

I work in food and beverage industry and this is my first time experiencing nonsense policy like that...
If you are looking for a good breakfast place, butterfields is ok option, but there are lots of other great places where you can order your food and drinks at the same time haha."
