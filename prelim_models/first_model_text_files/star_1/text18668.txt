I don't know how they get pass the health inspection. They seem to never clean their things. I found some dirty marks on my plates and my utensils. One word. Disgusting! Who would want to be at an unhealthy and unsanitary restaurants? I know I don't. I got one of the employee to change my utensils. They seemed to rolled their eyes just because I had them to change them. While they walk away, they probably think that I did not understand Vietnamese. Just because I'm Asian, that does not mean that I don't know any other dialect besides Cantonese or Mandarin. They were talking crap about me. They said that I was annoying and I took up their time up for getting me another utensils?! Really? Seriously?

Second thing I want to talk about is their food. Da Vang's meals are not as good as the past anymore. I have no idea what they have done to it. Their food are really cheap but are not worth it. I rather go to someone else to spend a little more money for great food, great service, and great sanitation than be at Da Vang.."
