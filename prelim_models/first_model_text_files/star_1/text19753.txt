However, I also expected the food to be delicious. The buffet is very mediocre run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet food. It took one walk around the buffet circle for me to realize I could have gotten the same food at a cheap China Star buffet. I went for dinner on a Friday night with three other adults and one child and the bill was $110. Nothing I ate was exceptional. The only thing I ate that was tasty was the tempura shrimp. We will definitely not be returning.
