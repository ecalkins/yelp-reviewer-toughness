The wings were wrong (both orders). All the waitress could say about the ""missing"" hamburger was ""ooops my bad"" really?..... what does that mean? The manager was so unhelpful and actually threw a fit because we were upset that the order was incorrect and that we were questioning why my husband still didn't have a meal..... needless to say we will not be returning to this Hooters. Or probably any Hooters as this was our first time"
