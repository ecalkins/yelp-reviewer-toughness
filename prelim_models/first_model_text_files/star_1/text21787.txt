Instead of being in a sweet honey type sauce it's in a tomato type sauce like spices up ketchup and it was just weird. The crab puffs were okay.  But the fried rice had no flavor and was incredibly dry. I'm not sure if there's anything that could make me come back here. I felt like I wasted my money.
