One of the employees who was not our waitress came by the table and complimented my boyfriend's tattoo and bent down to look at it. I told her I didn't appreciate her talking to him and all she said ""sorry I just like tattoos"" with a snotty attitude. Of course word travels fast and girls love to gossip. Eventually another girl who was not our waitress decided it was okay to also compliment his tattoo. Bet you girls wouldn't appreciate it if a girl did that your guy in front of you."
