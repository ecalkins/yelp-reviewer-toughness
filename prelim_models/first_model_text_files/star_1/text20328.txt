I have been going here since it opened at a Tokyo Express (and had been going to the Camelback TE since it open). Don't know what this guy was thinking when he took it over than ""Oh, how can i provide the worst food and expensive prices"". Well you succeed. The staple of this place is terriyki chicken and rice - it now swims in sauce and you must pay a dollar extra for brown rice (she did not mention that to me when she took my order). The small salad was $1.20. Now, by small I mean TINY  use to cost 50 cents... he achieved his goal there. My daughter had fried rice - now we have had fried rice there dozens of times but this Mensa member decided that making it spicy, adding peppers and onions would be good....NOT! And seriously - the decor - OMG!!! it  looks like Goodwill threw up. i will never ever step foot in that place again! BARF!"
