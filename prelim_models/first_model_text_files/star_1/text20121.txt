The discount is good for up to 35 gallons, while most cars only have a 14 - 18 gallon tank, and purchasing that much gas would require driving until the tank is empty, and then refilling.  Most people refill at a quarter or half a tank, reducing the discount to only about 10 gallons, or only $2.00, or less than 1% of the $280 in purchases.

Discounting gasoline in this way clearly encourages increased consumption of gasoline.  Customers who routinely use this discount are encouraged to purchase/ keep gas guzzling SUVs, the reduced cost of fuel makes it less painful to have a gas guzzler, and the large gas tanks in large SUVs and pickups increases the actual amount of the discount."
