Had to ask for naan as they were late in filling it up. As the freinds had to leave after lunch to attend some of the seminars ate quickly, paid my bill and left. Later find out that they charged a 15% surcharge ! I then remembered then when I paid my bill on a credit card all I ahd to was enter my pin. Usually establishments show us the amount and then ask whether you want to enter the tip as % or $. I asked the waiter, why and he said he did not know. I cash tipped him and left. 

I later called the waiter and and the manager to complain. I felt cheated. Please be careful. Wonder what the the waiter thought - that we were all from out of town and were not aware of the local customs?"
