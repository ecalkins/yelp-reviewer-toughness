When she returned she pretty much rushed us as if WE were the ones keeping HER waiting. Then she started to talk to us very condescendingly. Like we were idiots. And got pissy when our number didn't work, probably because she typed it in wrong. Really made me not want to go back there ever. Sorry lady if you hate your job that much then quit. Don't treat people like garbage.
