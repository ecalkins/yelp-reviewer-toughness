Refused to refill a kids drink...even tho they have before and ALL other Starbucks have done so!  Worst manager in evenings!  Also, they said they couldn't do a pour over of Sumatra for me...they could only do what was brewing!  Don't waste your time...go to starbucks at Indian bend and scottsdale road!
