My hubby and I were in Scottsdale for a wedding, and this place was highly recommended to us. When we got there, there were so many people waiting outside that we were sure we were in for a treat! Oh were we wrong! First of all, the wait was twice as long as they said it would be, and when we finally went and bugged the hostess, she said they had already paged us. Rather than apologizing, she made it out to be our fault, although we'd been clutching the stupid vibrator the whole time.

It was super busy, so I was willing to overlook that, and also the fact that our waitress never even slowed down or made eye contact while serving us... IF the food had been good. But it wasn't at all. I had the worst hash browns I've ever had in my life. They were dripping in oil, but oddly had no flavor at all. How hard is it to make hash browns? The California egg scramble was passable, but nothing special either. The blueberry pancakes tasted just like Denny's or IHOPS. Fine, but so not worth the hype, long wait, and extra price tag.

Basically, the food was NO DIFFERENT than a breakfast chain like IHOP or Denny's. And you don't need to wait an hour there. I guess a bonus is that unlike Denny's, you can leave Butterfield's without smelling like cooking grease. That's about it."
