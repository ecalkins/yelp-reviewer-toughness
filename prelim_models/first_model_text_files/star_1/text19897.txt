The sushi was not good.  As someone else had pointed out, if you go when it's not busy, I would agree that you are going to get old food.  

The sushi seemed like if you had went out for sushi and took the rest home with you and then  tried to eat it a couple days later, it's what it would be - rice beginning to get hard, aesthetics have changed, etc.  The presentation on the plates was not good at all.  It just looks sloppy and not very presentable.  I didn't get sick, so that was good.  

The crab legs were okay.  Asparagus tasted pretty good.  Butter pecan decent to okay.

The review would have been barely a 2 until the check came which was 46 dollars for 2 people, straight up buffet.  That drops it definitely to a 1.  When I told the guy at the front of the poor quality of the sushi, long story short he couldn't have cared less. Considering we could have went to sushi-holic instead and paid just under that for as much as I ate for really awesome sushi, I was quite annoyed.  Anyone who says this place is ""TOP QUALITY"", I have to look at as a suspect review from an owner or something, especially when the person has a low number of views (3).   Save your money and time and go elsewhere!"
