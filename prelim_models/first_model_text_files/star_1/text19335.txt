I was told that the only reason it wouldn't be unlimited was if they were on a wait and they would ask us to bowl in 1 hour increments. 1 hour later, we were into the 4th frame of or 3rd hour, with plenty of lanes open, and our game shut off and the screen  told us to contact the control desk. I go up to the desk, and hear them assigning our lane to another group. When I asked about this, the guy told us that they didn't know we were on the lane and they would add time, but I told them it was pointless because they just assigned a new group to our lane. The offered us no explanation other than our lane was shut off completely because they didn't know we were there, and they obviously were not on a wait (2 lanes next to us were empty). 

On top of that, we had to ask for a server because no one came to our lane after us being there for 20 minutes. saw multiple employees congregating instead of coming over to serve us. Not worth the price if they are just going to shut the lane off on you in the middle of a game with no timer warning."
