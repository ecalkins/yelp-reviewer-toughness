Me and my guest waited 45 MINUTES for our food. I cannot explain how poor the service was. There's no words to describe how the server did not care when the food took so long and no apology at all. There's definitely something wrong with the kitchen if food takes 45 minutes to reach the table. The lack of communication between the server to customer is atrocious. The customer sits there for 45 minutes staring at the server walking back and forth. 

Awful experience. I wonder if they went to India to catch the chicken for their chicken tikka masala. I've never seen chicken curry taking this long at any restaurant! 

Poor management and employees just don't care about their jobs. No wonder there's so many bad reviews. Should've read the reviews before coming here. NEVER AGAIN!"
