Forgot the fact that my tots were not on my plate, but fries were and then the tots were brought out at the end of my dinning experience! Why do you go to Buffalo Wild WINGS! FOR THE WINGS.  The wing were cold. And it wasn't like the were packed on a Friday night. No it was a Monday at 1:15pm.  There were only four parties in the entire restaurant! But when the word WING is in the name of the restaurant, at least don't sick at the wings. Then to just put some icing on the cake, it says 15 minutes or it is free. It take 17 mind the first time and another 17 minutes the second set of wings. My hour lunch brake turn into 2 and half hours mostly waiting on food or staff that was never around to get napkins, water or a check. They gave me a coupon for $5 off, yea... not worth it. That was my first and last time to this location and perhaps the last time to BWW. I will stick to Hooters!
