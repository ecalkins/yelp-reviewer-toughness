By the time you eat and do anything there with your family/kids, your bill is ENORMOUS. I would have paid less had I gone to Amazing jakes which is larger and has the all you can eat buffet. I give a 1 star for the sales manager Amy and her customer service skills (lack thereof) and for not helping in ANY way to keep the reputation of FlipSide and its staff...to be as flawless as it was the night that I visited with my children and their friends. And since she was my final impression, one start it is!
