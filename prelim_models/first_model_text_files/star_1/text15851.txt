Like United Airlines, they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation. The manager is an overweight rude guy. I explained to him that I had my reservation yet the guy didn't even let me complete my sentences, talked over me and was rude. He kept saying, ""I called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table."" Well, he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed. It's completely unacceptable to cancel someone's reservation. That's why you make the reservation in the first place. Remember the Sienfeld episode. Btw, I think if they're overbooked they're more likely to reject you if your name does not sound Caucasian... It's the colonial mentality."
