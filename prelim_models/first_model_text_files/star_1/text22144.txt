I order and pull to the window with my window still down....the vehicle in front of me is a taxi filled with drunk people one of them standing outside the car....(this is not against drink people ....my friends and I uber through late night drive through all the time.) As I pull up I hear the gentleman standing outside the cab say to the employee let me pay for the girl behind us too since we're obviously gonna take a while and hands him a bill. After waiting a very long time I get to the window and the employee CHARGES ME ANYWAY....I was directly behind this other customer when he offered this good deed and even watched the employee hand him change from the second transaction. How stingy are you??? like really?

I ordered the pollo asada bowl ....My food was disgusting..... I wanted to like it I was starving but the chicken was all fat I was gagging with every bite, I ended up throwing it away I couldn't even stomach eating around it. So disappointed.

Julibertos is just a few mins up the street and 1000 times better. Hope my experience can help yours."
