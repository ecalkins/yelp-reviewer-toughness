Uncomfortable bench seating.

Bizarre order at the front protocol.

The place smelled like old people and looked dirty and unkempt so I knew off the bat that I wouldn't order any raw fish.

If I could give zero stars, I would. 

The shrimp tempura roll was somehow gross due to the rice not being cooked right and the crab tasting fishy. Yech 

The Pad Thai was downright DISGUSTING.

I'm
Not sure why. Too much fish sauce? COLD TOFU on top that exploded with cold water when you take a bite. (SO freaking gross.). The shrimp tasted freezer burned. I didn't eat it and they didn't charge me thank god.

Oh boy. This place is bad. I feel bad for the nice guy who took my order."
