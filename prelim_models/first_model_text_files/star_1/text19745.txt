I was shocked that a mediocre at best buffet was nearly $80 for my wife, myself and my 3 small kids but the server actually followed us out to tell us that tip wasn't included. That was classlessness to the highest degree! I obviously filled out the receipt and knew the total I wrote. She didn't take our plates, we put them on another table, and they didn't fill our drinks. We ended up drinking water we brought while we waited. The sushi was old even though it had a wide variety. A wide variety of old sushi still isnt good. Half the food was empty and the place was empty. There were 3 cars in the parking lot. Overall, I will never go back and will tell everyone I know to not go there as well. The worst buffet I have had in Phoenix yet!!!
