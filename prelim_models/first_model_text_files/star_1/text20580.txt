Currently, our table has been waiting for almost two hours for our food order only for the server to report back my entree is unable to be made, even though I explicitly advised my allergies upon ordering. Furthermore our table was waiting so long part of our party left because of the terribly long wait. We've had multiple dirty glasses given to our party, had to get up and serve ourselves for water, bread, pepper. Upon describing the above to the manager, he did nothing! We are the only people in the restaurant by the way. This is absolutely THE WORST service ever!!!! PS. An 1.5 hours into this fun ordeal the manager finally offered a bottle of wine--little too late dude you should have offered this back when the 2nd bottle we attempted to order was out of stock. Update: to top it off our bill was completely wrong and the manager apparently left because he was nowhere in sight.
