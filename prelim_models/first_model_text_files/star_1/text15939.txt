My parents love this restaurant. So for their 28th wedding anniversary, I called to ask if Aroma issues gift certificates. The person I spoke to on the phone said ""yes, we do all the time"" and told me to ""come in anytime tomorrow"" to buy one.

I show up the next day. They tell me they can't access the gift certificates because they are locked in the owner's office and he isn't in. They, however, call the owner and then tell me that if I pay the $75 I want to put on the certificate, they will deliver it to my house the next day. 

It's now three days later and nothing has been delivered. I had to email them and also call them (and by the way, when I called, I was told ""yes I spoke to the owner yesterday and told him you wanted a gift certificate""). Uh, you did that THREE days ago. Why did you have to tell him again yesterday?

I am now without an anniversary present for my parents, all due to Aroma's shoddy service and misrepresentations. Food might be good but don't expect any service whatsoever - and don't try to buy a gift certificate here unless you want them to take your money and give you nothing in return."
