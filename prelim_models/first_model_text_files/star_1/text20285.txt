My kid and I went to get some California Rolls and it took more than 25 minutes and 5 complaints to 3 different employees to get our food.  It's not like it had to be cooked.  I even yelled out my complaint so everyone in the restaurant knew how upset I was.  When the food was delivered, it was almost thrown at us.  

I asked to speak to a manager - but there wasn't one available.

That is one restaurant that I will no longer frequent. Go there at your own peril."
