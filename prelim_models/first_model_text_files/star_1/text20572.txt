She put in the wrong order for our table; but you had to feel sorry for her cause the manager yelled at her. Anyone who has been to a Macaroni Grill knows they have an open kitchen; so we could hear everything. The bread wasn't as crusty as it used to be. The calamari was chewy and the batter was gritty. My Pasta Milano had too much rosemary. At the end of the meal, I noticed that our carafe of water had tiny black flakes in it.
