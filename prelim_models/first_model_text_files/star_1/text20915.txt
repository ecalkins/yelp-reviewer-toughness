Now, about the fries....they add some sort of barbecue seasoning to the fries that is just not good.  They might as well serve up a bag of BBQ chips. 

The place is very small and feels dirty.  They had boxes of Lucky Charms cereal behind the register and the place was just really messy and grimy.  

Customer service was fine but they really need a deep cleaning and improved layout for a better overall experience.  I won't be back and cannot recommend this place to anyone."
