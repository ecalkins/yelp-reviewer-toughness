Pre formed ,cheap tasting meat with frilly pickled onions ,avocado  and burnt black green chili! The fries some of which were up to 4 inches long,were very well cooked ,but most were 1 inch or less ,bottom of the barrel . 
Bun was similar to a ciabatta style ,smeared with a nondescript mayo based sauce that was not like anything I would knowingly eat again. These youngsters acted like they were serving prime meat,and the prices reflected it.  My wife's regular cheeseburger came with 3 slices of cucumber under a bunch of pickled red onion!
CUCUMBER. On a burger? These guys are trying to be different and are coming off as weird."
