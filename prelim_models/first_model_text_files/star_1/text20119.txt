The store is huge, has a large gluten-free section and I can stock up.  Well the store failed, the employees failed and I don't see a need to return.  yes the store has been remodeled but that does no good if the produce is rotten.  The tomatoes advertised on the holiday coupon special are moldy and covered in fuzz, when I asked the produce clerk if they had anymore- all i got was a shoulder shake, hummm I guess not.  When the bananas are over yellow and heading toward brown spots before dinner, again there are problems. The Udi's gluten free bread I purchased ($5.49 a loaf) has an expiration sticker of 5/18/2017 on it.  Sadly I didn't notice this until I got home and was making dinner,  I bought 2 loaves.  The store was out of many of the holiday coupon items and no clerks seemed to have answers or solutions.  I asked for paper bags, the bagger filled them with as much product as possible, jamming food and cans, frozen and delicate items all together.  The final straw was the delicate pastries turned ON THE SIDE to fit in the bag along with the milk and eggs.
Obviously this store does not need my $150.00, I can get gluten free at whole foods, sprouts, a different Frys, amazon or several other places."
