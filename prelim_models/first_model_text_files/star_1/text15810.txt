The major problem is the staff. The red head girl that eats while working the cash is rude and slow. Must be related because she would be gone a long time ago if I was in charge. Then the other server cut her finger and was licking her finger then handling food. So needless to say I ended up walking out. I won't be going back any time soon. The service is the kind of thing that can kill a place. The food has lots of potential. And the poor guys in the back look like they just want to put out some good food but the girls need to go.
