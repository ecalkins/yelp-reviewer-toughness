I was not getting why she didn't understand. So, back and forth again until she said...we have them in 10 or 20. Ohhh....well, you could've saved some time by saying that in the beginning. Anyways, i picked up my wings and they had no sauce and so i asked for sauce and she gave me a side of what looked like vomit. It looked as if the sauce broke or something. It was curdled almost. I dunno, but with another wing place right across the street, I'd tighten that situation up. Ew...just grosses me out to even think they would serve someone that.....crap.
