We used a coupon which was 20% off 2 dinner buffets.  And since we used that coupon we couldn't get a discount for my mother who is a senior(what is a senior discount a whopping 10% off).  The dinner buffet was expensive.  To top it off the 15% gratuity was added to the price before the discount.  I immediately took the check to the front to ask the lady why it was added.  Is that even allowed?  The manager came up and said she automatically adds 15% because they are so busy.  We came at 5pm when there were only a handful of customers. She asked if that was too much.  I replied that it should be my decision how much the tip is.   

She returned the check to me after taking off the gratuity.  I went back to the table and the waitress asked me if I had already paid.  I said no and she replied, ""You pay me.""  She saw that we had left a tip on the table.  When she bought back the receipt to sign she asked, ""Was the service bad?""  We replied, ""It wasn't bad but the empty plates were not taken away and our table was full while were eating.  She replied, ""So my service was bad and stormed away like a child.""  I didn't know employees could speak that way to paying customers.  I found it to be quite rude and off-putting.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment.  Obviously they didn't need or want our patronage."
