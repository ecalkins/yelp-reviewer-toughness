We went in,I had a plate of appetizers it was terrible. I being straving and already there went back for a plate of salad and some chicken fried rice. It was also terrible figuring that nobody can mess up chicken fried rice it was my last ditch effort. It tasted like dog food. I told the girl I was going to leave and she got the manager who told me it would be 6.99 for a lb of food. We ate in total a few crab puffs, at this point  I was frustrated I told her charge me whatever I just wanted to get out of this terrible experience. She then at the cash register gives me some bs about how we would have known right away if it was bad and know she's charging us for one person 20 dollars. I payed while letting her know she was losing a customer. She didn't care. If you want eat at a restaurant who values you as a guest definitely do not eat here. You shouldn't anyways the food sucks.
