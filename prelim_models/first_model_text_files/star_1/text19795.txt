I was most excited for the Sushi rolls, sashimi, and crab legs, and oh my, they were not good at all. I figured I'd settle for the things impossible to screw up- crab Rangoon's, gyozas, soup, etc-- again, very bad. 
I really do recommend you spend your money elsewhere. We will never be going back."
