Appetizers of fried ravioli was great. Salads were as expected. The main course was disgusting. Potatoes were in a bed of salt, the beef tasted like dog food and the chicken had no seasoning at all. The other issue is my husbands meals would be cold and mine were hot. The worst thing was when I went to the restroom while waiting for the bill. There were two employees cleaning the restroom. They cleaned the last stall, put their things away, and walked out of the restroom without washing their hands. Food can be chalked up to a bad night but there is no excuse for not being clean. Will not go to this place again.
