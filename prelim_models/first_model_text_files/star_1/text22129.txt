The food is terrible (dry) I know a special race who eats dogs that eater better than this piece of *poop-* establishment. Sadly will never be here again this location can lick it! It's rated a B and that's shows it's a problem in believe this place is serving week old food or dogs ! This facility needs to be investigated or revamped
