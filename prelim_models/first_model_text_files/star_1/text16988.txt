However, when the doors open at 11am, the staff aren't even ready to take orders and they're the ones slowing things down. It was past 1130 and they still weren't taking order from customers. Not one customer was served compelling 20 customers to leave. What's worse is the staff didn't even acknowledge this as if the customers were at fault for waiting. It was like they didn't care if customers were upset and left. It seemed like they preferred it. Even if the food was decent, I will never come back and do business with a staff that has such blatant disregard for their customers' experience and disrespect for their customers' time. If I could do ""zero"" stars and indicate ""stay away"" I would. All my friends and family will be staying away."
