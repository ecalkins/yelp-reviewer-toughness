I went last night with my boyfriend and two kids ages 8 and 10. We ordered no alcohol.  The bill came to $71.03 (not including tip) for four sodas and the buffet for two adults and two children.  I'd be less offended by what they are charging if the food was even somewhat decent. Do yourself a favor and forgo this one.
