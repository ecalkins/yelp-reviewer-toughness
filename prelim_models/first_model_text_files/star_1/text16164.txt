Evidently it has succumbed to the fad of rubs which makes a brisket taste like lighter fluid. The only seasoning used by BBQ experts is salt and pepper and smoked slowly using a wood like hickory. One sauce was one step above catsup, watery and no smoke. One was super hot which masks other flavors and the other one was to be used on pork mustardy which is the domain of east coast pork. I was very disappointed in the sides too. The pinto beans were watery and very spicy. The coleslaw was flavorless. When oh when. Do I have to travel to Kreuz in Texas?
