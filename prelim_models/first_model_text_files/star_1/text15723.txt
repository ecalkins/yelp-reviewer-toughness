Two burgers two fries two beers, $60!  That's almost forgivable as we are at an airport. The problem is that the food is TERRIBLE!  The burger tastes like dry cardboard, it's chilled and was obviously microwaved or just warmed up and not cooked. 
The service was slow. Lines around the corner and one person taking orders! We ordered a beer and the keg was not styled so it was just pure head. It took the cashier at least 2 min to pour a beer which does not sound bad except there are 15 people waiting in line! 
After we got out ""food"" the bartender got in an altercation with a patron as there are certain seats that are for alcohol drinkers only, and even though there is 6 people for 25 seats, service was still refused without an alcohol order. 
If you can please don't ever even look in the direction of this burger hell hole."
