I had to use a knife and fork, which diminished the sensory experience of biting into the burger. The meat itself was in pieces, not a whole patty. It was like I got the leftovers or something after the lunch rush (I went around 2 p.m.) The havarti cheese was sloppily placed on the burger pieces and was falling off the back of the bun. The sweet potato tots were greasy and sort of burned. The flavor of the burger was decent, but there were too many problems, especially aesthetically. And for the money, totally not worth it. I went way out of my way to go here (I live in Downtown Phoenix). Will not come back. I am sure the owner won't care, as the place was crowded when I left. Bleh.
