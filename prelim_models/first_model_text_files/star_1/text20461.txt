Upon entering, the first thing we noticed was how empty the entire place was. We discussed how incompetent the service probably was. We decided, against our better judgement, to give the place a second chance. We ordered drinks and it seemed like a lifetime before they were served! There were a few drinks that were served that were not what was ordered, the rest of the drinks were room temperature!!! Now, once the drinks is were finally straightened out... we ordered some appetizers... those were on point! The only reason I gave them a single star...(We should've stopped there!)
We proceeded to order dinner... 13 meals... every single meals was a debacle! A medium well burger was literally RAW! The wings were ice cold as were the fries... the boneless wings were nothing but cut up chicken breasts with hot sauce over them! Our entire party was extremely dissatisfied with the service.
 Here is the the kicker... I and my party belong to the VFW which were attending a convention here in Scottsdale... hundreds of veterans and their families that I am sure pumped thousands of dollars into this city. For an upscale city, Hooters is an absolute disgrace!!!"
