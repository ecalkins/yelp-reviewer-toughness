FILTHY! ordered brisket,turkey,sausage and pulled pork. brisket was dry and tasted like dog food. horrible! turkey was chewy. not sure if it was under cooked or not. horrible! sausage tasted like bologna. horrible! pulled pork wasn't bad. the only meat that I finished. being from Texas I've had some good BBQ. this place is nowhere close! wouldn't last a week in Texas! could've gone to Luby's to get better meat. very disappointed. don't waste your time listening to all the hype. or if you do believe the hype, I've got some ocean front property here in AZ to sell ya!
