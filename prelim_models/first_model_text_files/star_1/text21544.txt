We ordered the beach house and BBQ burger, as well as fries and tater tots. It took about 30-40 minutes to get our food, but again, it was really busy, so we shrugged it off. When we saw our burgers coming they looked like they were going to be really good, so we were getting even more excited... Unfortunately, the patties were cold, yet overcooked and completely flavorless, the cheese was ice cold, it felt like it was just taken out of the fridge and because of that fell off the burger, and the bread fell apart. The tater tots tasted like the cheap frozen ones from the grocery store, but at least the fries were okay. I don't understand my experience given the reviews, but maybe I just came on a really REALLY bad day. I don't think I'd go back. I would recommend Zinburger or Hopdoddy over this place any day.
