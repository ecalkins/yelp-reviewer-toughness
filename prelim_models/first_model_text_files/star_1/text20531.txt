The service was horrendous (ordered soup and salad which arrived 25 minutes apart and the soup was cold), my glass of white wine was warm and the bruschetta was pathetic. Simply awful. The manager did adjust our bill to compensate for our completely disappointing experience, which was appreciated, but we'll never be back. Too many other fantastic options out there.
