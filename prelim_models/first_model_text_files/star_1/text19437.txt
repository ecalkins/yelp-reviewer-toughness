It's pretty simple, it's right off the menu, no add-ons.   I often shop at the Basha's in the same complex, so every once in a while, I used to stop off at this Starbucks.  It is an abomination.  They never put the milk back in the fridge, the don't listen to your order, or if they do, they give you someone else's drink.  It's not just one thing, it's EVERYTHING about it, from the rude staff to the inept staff to the inept staff to the rude staff.

In any case, just drive by this Starbucks and hit the one on 16th and Bethany, where they always get your drink right the first time."
