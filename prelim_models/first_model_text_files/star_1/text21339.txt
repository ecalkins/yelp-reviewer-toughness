I've been disappointed with some DDD spots, but this one is the worst place I've ever eaten at. The entire place is extremely dirty (floor, tables and condiments area). It's clear the owner(s) are over their heads when it comes to service; took 45 minutes to get two burgers! Hamburgers were skimpy and without flavor. I orders two burgers; Boos Burger and Country Burger, which was featured on DDD. There are many other options when it comes to burgers in the area such as Smash Burger, Five Guys, etc. Don't waste your time or money....even the run down strip center is dirty.
