My first visit to this store was going very well until I went to check out and had a very rude, unpleasant encounter with a cashier named Toney.  The checkout lines were backed up, with exception of the express line with nobody in it.  Express states approximately 15 items.  I started to unload my groceries when the cashier loudly and rudely told me I couldn't use her lane, pointing to the item sign.  I had 17 items.  Yep, I'm a rogue!  I explained that all other lines were backed up and she had nobody at all in her line waiting.  This didn't sway her.  I moved to one of the other lanes and the customer in front of me pointed out the empty express line.  She, too, couldn't believe this cashier wouldn't wait on me!  We watched while Toney the cashier stood there with nobody in her lane, doing absolutely Nothing.  This is a POOR reflection on management, horrible customer service mentality.  Too bad, the store itself is nice... but who wants the aggravation?!?
