The location must be keeping them alive.  Im sure locals dont eat here.  I am usually a fan of mom and pop restaurants but these people are in desperate need of help.  I am not here to give restaurant advice to restaurants.  I am here to warm people of bad food.  You've been warned Do not eat sushi here it is not good, fresh or worth it.
