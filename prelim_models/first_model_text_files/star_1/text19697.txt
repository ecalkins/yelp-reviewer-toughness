He ordered a patty melt - which was extra greasy - and chili cheese fries which came out with no chili, no cheese... But! We did pay for the extras, just never got them. I ordered a mushroom and swiss burger and an order of fried mushrooms on the side. This last time was a real kicker to the intestines for both of us; he had to use several napkins to blot up the grease on his patty melt so it was edible, and his chili cheese fries were just fries. This was the third time he had order and paid for chili cheese fries and the third time we got home with our order sans chili/cheese...

After eating our mediocre birthday meal, things seemed okay. By midnight, we were both experiencing the side affects of food poisoning; the city sewer was busier than usual in other words. While his temporary dysentery had eased by lunch time the next day, I spent the night with cold sweats, vomiting, and passing out from the pain. My intestinal fortitude had seemingly burst from what we can only guess were noxious mushrooms. My illness lasted a gut-wrenching 72 hours.

We won't be spending any more money at this establishment. The fact that the place has all the visual distractions of giant metal animal statutes outside and more "" nostalgia"" on the inside, should be a clue that they don't want you paying afternoon to what you are eating. 

As Mr. Wonderful always tells me, if you have to dress something up that much to sell it, you are clearly trying to overcompensate for something else. 

Buyer beware."
