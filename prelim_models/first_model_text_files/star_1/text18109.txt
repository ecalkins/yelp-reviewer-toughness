Waitress was friendly but forget the milk for our coffee. My hubby ordered the  Mexicana Omelet and I the wildberry bliss crepe. Both were NOT fresh made.     The omelet was dry and hard. The mascarpone inside the crepe was... horrible. Overall, both dishes were not warm enough.
I do NOT recommend this place. In our eyes, only good for people who just want to eat... for eating.
The upcoming days, we will return to Butters Pancake Cafe."
