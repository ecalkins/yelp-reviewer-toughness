I typically go to Pho Thanh (which is much better by the way), but they were closed today for some reason. So I decided to give Da Vang another shot.

When I was seated, the table next to me asked if they could be served and the server said he'd be right back. The table got frustrated and left, which was a red flag I should have taken into consideration. It took 15 minutes after being seated to even be acknowledged by a server. Then after we ordered, we got our pho before we got our spring rolls. We brought this to the server's attention and he brought it out right away, so he basically forgot. 

But now onto the actual food quality. The pho was mediocre at best. There was little flavor and tasted pretty bland overall. I ordered the large while my friend got the regular. The bowl sizes were different, but I'm almost positive that they just put the same amount of food in both sizes. The large just had more broth. 
The spring rolls were mediocre as well. Didn't taste fresh like they should have. Their ""peanut sauce"" wasn't even peanut sauce, it was hoisin sauce with crushed peanuts on top. 

Overall, this place has fallen off. I hope Pho Thanh is only closed temporarily because I won't be coming back to this spot."
