The pasta rustica apparently was given to someone else, so had to wait longer, and then it was a little burnt on the top. Then they charged me for two iced teas and we only orders one. The server was not that good, didn't bring out bread, I had to ask for it. I'm going back now to complain, and I won't be eating here again.
