Then given a table and menus but not told we needed to order at the counter, so we waited for a while until we realized no one was serving at the tables.  Burgers were good, but the service was slow and the server had an attitude.  There was a man busing the tables and he continued to stand around our table with a dirty wet rag dangling in our faces for over 10 minutes.  Then he sat down and continued to stare at us.  We first thought he was doing that so we would leave and free up a table, but there were several empty tables at the time.  All of our party noticed his behavior and didn't like it.  If surly service and a less than clean dining room was done to add to the ""Dive"" atmosphere then they succeeded.  None of our party will be back."
