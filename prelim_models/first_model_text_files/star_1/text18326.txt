They had borrowed napkins from the neighboring table and when they realized they had missed some, the asked the other table to borrow some more. At this point, the owner scolded the family for excessive napkin use and that they MUST ask him for any extra napkins. The family told him they just wanted to finish their meal and move on from what now had escalated to an ordeal. I overheard the husband ask the owner for another napkin as they had been directed and the owner snapped!! He called them smartasses and excessively yelled at them calling them horrible names. He then proceeded to kick them out (though I'm sure they would have left ASAP regardless due to his behavior) and told them he was CONTACTING THE POLICE for disorderly conduct. I'm not sure what resulted but as someone with connections to law enforcement, it seemed that the owner was harassing the family with his verbal assaults not the other way around. He's lucky they didn't call the cops on him. 

To the owner: I know owners are encouraged to respond to reviews. DO NOT respond to mine or I will contact the BBB. There is nothing to discuss. Also, screaming, ""FUCK YOU!""  in anyone's face, let alone a woman's, is never respectable."
