Walked into the restaurant at around 7:30 on a Tuesday and was not greeted for a full 5 minutes before deciding to seat ourselves. Our server came to get our drink order and after dropping off the drinks, she went to sit down 3 tables away from us to eat wings of her own with her fellow co workers. As she proceeded to take breaks between bites to serve us, it became more and more disturbing watching her lick her fingers and getting up to serve guests & garnish drinks without washing her hands. She was not the only server doing this. There were a few others at the table eating and on their phones- very unprofessional. To top it all off, we noticed our server was wearing open toed Nike Slide sandals. Overall, this place is run very poorly. If you're looking for wings, I would recommend any place over this one.
