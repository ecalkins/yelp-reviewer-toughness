We walk in and the host handed us menus and silverware and told us to seat ourselves to ""save him the trip""... already off to a rude start. Every waitress looked like they just rolled out of bed and didn't know which tables were theirs. Our food was cold, soggy and took ages to come out. Absolute garbage. The only thing that want horrible was the beer. Definitely come here if you love microwaved food and terrible service"
