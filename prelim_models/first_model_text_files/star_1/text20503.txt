It took us 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by a waiter after we were seated. Both the appetizers and the food took forever to come out and when they did were tasteless and awful. The restaurant wasn't that crowded, yet the service was slow and when I asked my waiter for parmesan cheese, it never came. The portions of pasta were small considering the expensive price. Thankfully, they didn't charge my friend twice when she didn't like her food the first time. 
I would not recommend this restaurant and suggest you stay far away."
