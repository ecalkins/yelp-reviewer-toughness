I picked ""DA VANG"" because of the great reviews.  All i have to say was that this placed literally sucked.  The service was horrible. The waiters took our order then took almost 20 mins to get our food. I don't know if they cared that their customers came to eat and were hungry.  Second, the food that arrived was overcooked. The meat was hard, the beef tendons were obviously old and the soup was too sweet.  Overall, if you want pho, try some other place. If you're in Los angeles, I can recommend tons of great places that are fraction of the price with great service.  

Overall, Da Vang was a horrible experience, overpriced, bad food, bad experience. I will never go back to this place."
