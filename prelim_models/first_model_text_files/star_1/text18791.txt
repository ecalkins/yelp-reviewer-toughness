I'm not sure why this establishment has a solid 4 star average.  I guess people like to eat water flavored pho and water flavored everything, basically.  I haven't had food from this place in years, but since our regular spot was closed, we came in here to get our fix.  

After our meal, I remembered why I hadn't visited this place for a long time. The food sucks.  And I feel bad for everyone who thinks this place is awesome, cause you guys have sterile taste buds."
