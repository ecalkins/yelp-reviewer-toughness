My food tonight went from paying for it, car ride home, my garbage. Absolutely disgusting. What happened to this place!? The owner was even there! Before I could open the cover on my soup, all smelled was the spoiled spinach. The soup tasted completely sour. My son's chicken(?) had the texture of jerky and had to have been pretty old. The edamame was Brown and looked as though it had been frozen, boiled, refrigerated and boiled again. I'm disgusted. I've always stuck up for this place. Never again. I will never return. Years of a constant customer gone. Well done.
