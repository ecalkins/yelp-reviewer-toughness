I stopped in cuz I really like Chinese food and thought a nice selection of food would be worthy. Oops ... Wrong. Lackluster flavor and chewy , rubbery food made this dining experience a big disappointment. It's a place for large appetites and no taste buds. Shoulda realized something was up cuz the place was only visited by working men looking to pack in the calories over lunch. I'm not a big buffet person and now I know why."
