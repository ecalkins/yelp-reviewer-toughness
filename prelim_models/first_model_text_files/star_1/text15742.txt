This place basically just is serving McDonald's or bk burgers on a crappy bun. 16 bucks for a burger and fries would be happy to pay that if it was good

But good news is a walburgers is opening right across the hall. I've had there burgers in Dorchester when I lived down there and they weren't bad so hopefully there will be a better burger soon"
