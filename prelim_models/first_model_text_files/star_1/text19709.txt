The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table.  I actually liked the hamburger.  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order.  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that.
It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce."
