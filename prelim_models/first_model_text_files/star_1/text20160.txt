I went in today with my mom to get some stuff we needed. Because that's what you do at the grocery store, right? Good News!! that is exactly what I got. Plus an unexpected political lesson, and a critical bag boy. So we had a good experience throughout the visit, but the check out experience was probably the worst I ever been part off. First we are putting stuff up on the belt and we hear the check out boy Brandon G was telling the girl checking out that he doesn't know how anybody could like trump. It shows how stupid your bag boy William is to agree and say yeah. That's when I was like ""This is going to happen right now?"" I just want Fry's to know how dumb their associates are. Not only are you talking about politics at work, but you're wondering how anybody could like Trump, in a state that voted him in. Not trying to get political on this, but that's a different kind of dumb. Obviously someone had to like him Brandon. So after all that happened they began discussing stuff that we bought, like we weren't there. I'm 6'7"" 245 pounds...how could you not see me? I'm huge...Again different kind of dumb... So, Brandon G and William what did we learn today? DON'T talk politics at work. ESPECIALLY in a customer service job. I did customer service for 4 years and the one thing we learned is to NOT express any sensitive topics with customers. DUH. DON'T discuss customers grocery's in a negative way. As a businessman, and a customer, that's a huge turn off. why would i want to buy something that you the the associate, don't like? So William and Brandon G, I hope you learned a lesson in customer service. If you have any questions refer to any customer service handbook ever made. You guys where awful. I will not be back, ever! Hope you're happy :)"
