Just awful, and over priced - even for airport food.

Burgers were dry, tasteless, and felt like microwaved, boiled meat. The cheese was congealed, the lettuce limp, and the toppings wrong. Add in miserable service, a rude bartender, and music so loud you couldn't hear the person taking your order.

That may be one of the worst meals I have ever experienced."
