I walked in with another guest at around 2:30PM in the afternoon, they refused to serve me buffet even though I told them what they had visible on the buffet was fine.  Their issue was that it was ""past the time"" and they would apparently rather waste the food then sell to 2 more buffet customers.  The waiters there have no problem turning customers out of the door."
