The hotel had advertised this restaurant,  the reviews were great and I decided to go there. I went there wanting to just take my food and eat it at the hotel room where I could get comfortable but I can honestly say I took longer deciding what to order than it took for them to actually hand it off to me  which makes me question the integrity of how they make their food since I ordered the beef crunchy noodle. The customer service was horrible, no eye contact, no courtesy when speaking directly to the customer, and I know they had the potential for it because there was a woman sitting besides me which she was greeted by a warm,  loud hello followed with laughter and a full blown conversation while I was just handed my food followed by a hurried ""bye"". I get to the hotel and guess what? There was no fork included with my order but luckily the hotel provided me with one.  Hoping that the food was going to be as stellar as everyone had posted and have my troubles compensated by the taste of this food... I can say I was sorely disappointed.  The beef was chewy,  it tasted overcooked, it was just disguising eating it that I just ended up throwing the food away.  It was a waste of time,  gas,  and of $10.29 out of my account but lesson learned. The fortune cookie was tasty though :)"
