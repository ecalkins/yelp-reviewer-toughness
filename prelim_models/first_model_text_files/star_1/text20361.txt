I work across the parking lot of the restaurant, I always order an egg roll for pick up, due to having a short amount of time for my breaks, etc. Today I called just like I usually do, I had to call 9 times before they answered their phone. When they answered I believe he greeted me with ""what?!"" and I said, ""excuse me?"" and he said ""stop calling. Come in to order, we are busy!"" and hung up before I could say another word. So I take my break, go to the restaurant and they have all of about 4-5 tables, nothing close to busy, they are just lazy. I order my ONE egg roll. Two other families walk in and are ignored for about 10 minutes. The families are finally sat after about 15 minutes when they had open tables the entire time. I WAITED 45 minutes for an egg roll. Was not apologized to or anything. It took that incredibly long to get one egg roll made, when I know those are frozen and just need to be thrown in the fryer. 

I get back to work and there is chaos and havic due to me being 15 minutes past my scheduled break time. I had to wait to eat my food, therefore it was cold AND  they made me the wrong egg roll, it has meat in which I am a vegetarian and unable to eat it. I did not have time to leave and go get another one and god forbid I call them and ask them to have a new one ready. They cannot even understand you when you speak to them because they barely understand simple English as well as them being ""too busy"" to take pick up orders. 

This is not the first time this whole hung up and come in to order thing has happened either. I definitely will avoid coming there again at all costs."
