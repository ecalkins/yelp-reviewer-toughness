So we are trying to book a birthday party and all of my contact information is on the request.  We get everything lined out, I tell the associate to call me for the deposit, put my personal phone down and get back to work.  Never hear from her.  She didn't call.  She responded to the e-mail that she was there all day and to give her a call.  I got busy, didn't find this for weeks.  Finally make an effort to re-connect - no call back, no e-mail back, no anything for almost a full week ... I desperately wanted this to work for my daughter, but I'm getting a really bad vibe already.  I don't like chasing people ... so until I get the attention I deserve, I'm not changing my rating."
