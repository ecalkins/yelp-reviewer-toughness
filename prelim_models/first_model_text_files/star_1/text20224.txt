I had four employees in different sections of the store be completely rude to me.  I asked a question of them, and was given a real ""you are bothering me"" type attitude.  At the end of my visit, I needed help with the self checkout, and no one was in sight.  I tracked down someone walking by, asked my question, and got an actual eye roll of disapproval!  He just walked away... Then I asked someone else, and she just grabbed the items out of my hand and started to ring them up really fast.  I said, I just asked for instruction on how to do this myself, can you show me?  She replied ""There's no need to say that!"" in an annoyed way.  Employee at Starbucks was rude as well, wouldn't even look at me or say hello.  Is everyone so stressed out at this location?  The management really needs to hone in and retrain the employees on how to speak and assist their customers. We are the reason they have a job there. I don't expect employees to be my best friend, I just expect them to be polite and helpful.  Disappointing for sure.  I sure don't feel welcome at that location, and won't be going back anytime soon!"
