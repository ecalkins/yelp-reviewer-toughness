I am giving a 1 star because the hostess was super nice and bottles beer was good.  Otherwise the cooked dishes were all luke warm.  The orange chicken had been sitting all day and was soggy/mushy instead of crispy. Peppered beef had a sitting all day flavor. Sushi was sitting out and down to few items on each tray. A couple of the sushi rolls were sitting in puddles of juice. 

Flavor seemed bland. Spicy dishes had no spice.  I just hope and pray we don't get food poisoning. Will never go back!"
