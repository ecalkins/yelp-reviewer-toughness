One of my last visit I told the lady I wanted almond milk (because of my lactose intolerance) and she brought me soy milk in my drink (which I'm also allergic to) and I don't like to complain and I'd already waited in the line far longer than I should have an was running late so I just ended up paying for a drink I had to throw away. My most recent visit I went in because the line was so long at the drive-through, inside wasn't busy at all but for some reason it still took 15 minutes for them to make my drink which I only I realized was even made cause the lady who came in 5 minutes after me went up and found her drink waiting there (for however long) because no one called anyones names or drinks out letting them know they were ready, they were just putting drinks over there and just walking away.  I walked over to see if my drink was there and (what was supposed to be my drink) didn't have a name or drink name anywhere on it (so how would anyone even know it's their drink being that names/drink orders weren't being called). I finally realized that drink was made incorrectly (hot instead of iced like I ordered) and they went to remake it to remake it and I took my drink expecting it to be made properly this time but they put whole milk in it, even though I requested almond milk and ended up drinking a decent amount of it before I realized it wasn't almond milk. So not only did I have to have my drink remade cause they didn't properly make it the first time but I got a drink that actually made me violently sick because I drank something that was supposed to be in my dietary restrictions but it wasn't made properly the second time. Never going back to this location again ever again.
