I was in on the 10 th of June the drink I ordered  cost 6.37 the order was made wrong.. so I had asked to have it remade and to speak to the manager who read back my order completely wrong .. when I did receive the new one it was wrong again .. I took it home threw it away .. I couldn't believe how poor the service and product was.. I did go to a different location down the street soooo much better(:
