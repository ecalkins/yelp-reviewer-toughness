I went to Aroma with my team as part of our Diwali Celebration lunch and i am very disappointed. Compared to before, the restaurant is revamped to make room for more people, they got rid of the big salad bar with chickpeas, lentils, quinoa, beetroots etc and replaced it with the general salad bar where they have 2-3 types of chutney and chopped cucumber and tomato.

The main dish bar had most of the items a normal Indian buffet has but the only thing worth eating was the Tawa Chicken.

ChickPea curry (Chole masala) was sweet, Matar Paneer hardly had any paneer. Buffet had no type of Dal (lentils). Butter chicken was half cooked. The dessert only had Gulab Jamun and Ice Cream in a corner of the restaurant where the line up for the buffet starts and it felt like you are in a local train in Mumbai trying to get to the dessert.

If i could go back i would trade my buffet at Aroma for a hot-dog from the vendor across my office.

I would have given the rating of 2 star if i hadn't eaten at Aroma before but the way quality of food has deteriorated in the restaurant makes me extremely sad. It seems like the restaurant only cares about making money without investing in the quality of the food.

I think because Kama has now closed, Aroma has lesser competition and don't care about the quality of the food."
