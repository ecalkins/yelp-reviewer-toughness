I was hoping it was just indigestion, but symptoms turned they way they do when I've been ""glutened""). 

They have gluten free waffles and pancakes on the regular menu, so I went in with high hopes. I asked about the hash browns and sausage links and were told they were GF. I ordered the GF pancakes (which come as a side to the two egg breakfast). The pancakes had a very strange aftertaste (almost like there was cheap, not-cooked-out, too much vanilla extract... it was strangely alcoholic) and I wasn't convinced of the texture (VERY spongey). The hash browns were meh, plus I think they were the culprit. They tasted frozen (there's a certain texture that fresh hash browns have, and frozen hash browns are always suspect as most frozen potato products are coated in flour to prevent sticking together). While the ingredient list may not have listed gluten, would someone have noticed if it just said flour, especially if it didn't say wheat? I just don't know. 

They were also out of any caffeinated black tea. For breakfast. At a breakfast joint. I ended up with a passable green tea, but it wasn't fabulous.

I won't be back."
