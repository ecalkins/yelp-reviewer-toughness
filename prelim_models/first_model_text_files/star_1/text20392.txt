It was a Tuesday night and they had plenty of staff and maybe 1/8 of their tables full. The kicker here is the waitress spent 10 minutes flirting with the table directly next to us and when she was done WALKED RIGHT PAST US. We eventually got fed up with the lack of service and walked to the bartender to ask for our check. This was the first time in my life I've never left a tip.
