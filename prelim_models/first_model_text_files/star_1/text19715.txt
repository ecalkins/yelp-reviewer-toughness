But after walking around the buffet line my stomach started to tell me I shouldn't eat here ever!!! I wanted to sample everything on my plate, so I filled it up with sushi sashimi, beef and broccoli, fruit, meat, and sushi rolls! I went back to the table and started to eat my first bite and it was absolute ass! It was basically rubber meat, expired salmon, the sushi was darkened in color:(. The fruit was dry. The rice was weird tasting. I spit everything out and hated all the food!! They even yelled at me to finish my rice before I could even get more damn food! What type of restaurant yells at you, oh yea Jasmine Tokyo does! The service is shit! That explains my tip I left them! $0.00 !! And they never refilled my glass of water . Overall, Now I'm shitting currently in their bathroom where I'm going to clog the toilet so they have to pay the plumbing bill as their expense for feeding me this shitty food! Enjoy the poop in your toilet Jasmine Tokyo! It's a big one! Don't waste your money everyone ! Such a ripoff as you can tell they buy in extreme bulk from China and serve you a plate of expired shit! And the atmosphere is themed of a camping cabin! Wtf does this have to do with sushi! Do you guys have any brains?? I hope you read this message so you can shut the business down and save everyone their hard earned paychecks to be kept in their pockets and not in your hands!! Good bye or should I say ZaiJian!
