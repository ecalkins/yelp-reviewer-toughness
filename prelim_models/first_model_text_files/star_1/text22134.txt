I love hot sauce and I like a lot of it on my food. This last time we ordered 2 meals and she would only give us 4 tiny hot sauces. I like filibertos because it is convenient, not necessarily because it's that good. The hot sauce made it good and now that I can't get the hot sauce I want there's no point in stopping by.
