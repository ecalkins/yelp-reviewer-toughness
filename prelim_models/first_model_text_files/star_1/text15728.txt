Well on Friday I found myself in Pearson with two hours to kill before my flight and needed something to eat. There's really nothing of note as most of places sell the same things. Check it out if you don't believe me. For the most part they all sell the same things at the same prices. So enter True Burger.

What can I say that's positive about them? Not much. It will keep you from starving assuming you're able to choke it down. And that's really about it.

For the price I was paying, and from the name of the place, I was expecting some freshly ground burger that was expertly grilled and served with my choice of toppings. It was served with my choice of toppings so they got that part right. But they charge for just about everything including things like tomatoes and pickles which are typically free with any other burger. No here, you pay an extra $.25 cents per ""premium topping"". Never heard of tomatoes and pickles being premium, maybe they need to pass through a security checkpoint and are taxed differently once they get to the airport.

The thing that I got, that cost $12.00 I might add, was some rubbery thing on a bun that looked and tasted like it had taken a bath in salt water before being thrown in the microwave to get it lukewarm. I'm not kidding. There was a severe lack of grilling and the meat had a manufactured texture to it that had too much salt for my liking. 

I literally couldn't finish it, it was that bad. Along with a bottle of beer it was about $22.00 which is disgusting for what you actually get. 

I understand that the airport has fees and costs a bit more to get the products you might need but they're really sacrificing quality in their quest for bigger profits."
