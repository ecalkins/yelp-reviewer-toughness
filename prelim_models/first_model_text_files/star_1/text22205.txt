I ask her how long it will be and she says I can't tell you how long. I tell her that I am only looking for an estimate of how long but she says sorry I can't tell you how long, there are three people in front of you and they have been waiting for at least half an hour. She really didn't even sound like she wanted us there. I definitely wasn't going to wait indefinitely not knowing how long the wait was going to be and I left.
