Seaweed salad was old, lumpy and rancid, I sent it back after one bite. No apology or attempts to make it up.

Soy sauce bottle was nearly empty, and absolutely filthy.

Second climax roll is over sauced, and the seaweed sticky and old. Cucumber is dry and extremely unpleasant. I was also served the tiniest glob of wasabi, not enough to last the whole roll. I gave up after two bites, for fear of an upset stomach.

I left after canceling my check. The waiter would not bring me the manager, and offered no apologies, yet again.

I would not even recommend this restaurant to somebody I hated."
