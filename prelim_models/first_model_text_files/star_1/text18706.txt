We have planned a trip for a nice family dinner to Da Vàng for serval months, and finallly was able to go there yesterday. 

We casually know the family who own this restaurant, but some of their workers leave much to be desired --- particularly the older, short, skinny man who takes the orders. He never ever seems to listen to the specifics of our orders. He does not repeat back to us what we ordered, especially when asked he heard what we just said. SMH. 

We ordered several items and one of which was 2 extra large bowls of wonton soups. The wonton fillings were hard and the taste was sour, as though spoiled. The broth was off from what we are used to with their cooking. 

We ordered the spring rolls with grilled pork and chicken. The grilled pork was extra dry and tasteless. 

This is so unusual for them, or maybe not. 

We have come to the conclusion that as their reputation expands and more people are coming in, they are too laxed and banking too much on their popularity, and NOT ENOUGH on the quality of the food and services. 

We will not come back. There are just too many options now for good Vietnamese food in the Phoenix metroplex, to waste our money and precious time/energy on subpar food and low-level service."
