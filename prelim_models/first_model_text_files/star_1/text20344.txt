I ordered a Philly and a crunchy California roll. Husband ordered a bento style meal that included some chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, some sort of steak, ginger salad, cucumber salad, and a California roll. I was thrilled at the size of my Philly roll when they delivered it to the table. Until I took a bite. My mindset did a downward spiral from ""We're always coming here!"" to ""There's no way I'd ever want to finish half of this."" Husband tasted each item of his bento box and was pretty much set to go get food from anywhere else. Ultimately, I ate my crunch roll, but couldn't continue with the Philly and got my money refunded without a word from the manager.

I used to like it here for an inexpensive roll or two with a beer, but the new ownership has cheapened the name. Many items on the menu are no longer offered, which is to be expected, but it's time to print out a new one. Happy hour is still expensive... and that's just for food because they don't offer alcohol. And maybe it's time to take down your Christmas tree?"
