Other than that...service was horrible, they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles. The manager just moved us to the table next to where we were sitting. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was empty!  Needless to say I will never go back to this neighborhood restaurant.
