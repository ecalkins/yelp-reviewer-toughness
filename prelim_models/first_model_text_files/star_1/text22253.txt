The fights hadn't even started yet and the sound was on for tv analysts discussing the fights. I'd understand him refusing to put the sound on for the hockey game if the fight was actually happening at that moment, but the fights hadn't even started yet and wouldn't for another four hours. He told me the prelim fights were on but he wasn't even on the correct channel! He further told me that if he put the sound on for hockey that would upset the UFC fans, and once UFC actually started he would have to switch the sound again, which in turn would upset the hockey fans. Mind you, I only saw one guy wearing an affliction shirt, so I think it's safe to say that the UFC fans hadn't really arrived yet.

I just found it very odd that the manager was more concerned about customers that weren't even there yet then customers that were in his restaurant spending money at that moment. Apparently, customers that will spend $5 to nurse their beer the whole night in order for them to watch a PPV fight are more important then my girlfriend and I who ordered beers, an appetizer, and 20 wings. 

Also another note, we weren't the only table asking for the sound to be changed to the hockey game. 

I'll be taking my business to Hooters."
