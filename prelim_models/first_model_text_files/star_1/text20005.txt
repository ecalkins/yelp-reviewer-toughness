I picked up more than 3 lb lunch. At checkout they billed me as 7.99/lb . Waiter was noob guy and manager came (chinese lady) and said menu prices was wrong!!!?!!!?? He said something in chinese to that guy and he quickly run to menu board and wiped 4.99/lb price and changed it to 7.99/lb . What a chinese way of serving people?!!?!? I hate this place and won't go anymore there since manager even five a s**t to apologize doe incorrect price."
