The situation and showed them my receipt and they acted like this was my fault and did not want to help me and told me they could not do anything and I would just have to talk to someone there tomorrow let's just say that situation never got taken care of. 2ed time I went there I ordered 2 chicken tacos lucky I was charged the correct amount but they gave me a cheese quesadilla. 3rd time and last time ever I got the carne asada fries..... ate them .....8 hours later I was in the hospital with severe food poisoning. I would not recommend this place to anyone go anywhere else. It's not just about the food being wrong or them charging me over 50 dollars for A quesadilla or me being stuck in the hospital with food poisoning. The staff is just so rude and don't care about there costumes. Stay away for your own safety!"
