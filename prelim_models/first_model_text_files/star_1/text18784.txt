Idk if I should be angry at myself or them but I went in and did takeout of their Pho Da Vang and when I finally got to my desk to eat it, the meat was completely raw ! I tried calling them to ask them if I was supposed to request cooked meat and he thought I was ordering a bowl of Pho. Guess I'm skipping lunch today."
