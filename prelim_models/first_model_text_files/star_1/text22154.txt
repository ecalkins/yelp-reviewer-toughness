He said he'd take care of it and disappeared.  After waiting for quite awhile I went up to him and told him he had said he would take care of getting us drinks. He was kind of snippy and said she's right there.  Our server had finally showed up to get us refills! I told the manager that she had just now shown up. He came over and apologized. Then she brought us our check without checking to see if we needed boxes which we did. We had asked for separate checks which we did not receive! Then we waited and waited and waited for her to come pick up the check because we needed change. Had to flag the manager down once again! We will NEVER go back there!
