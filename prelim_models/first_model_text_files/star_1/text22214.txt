The dining room was so crammed with tables, it was completely uncomfortable.  We ordered regular and boneless wings, and we told ten minutes later that they had run out of boneless wings.  The server had told us that the wing sauce was not spicy, yet we couldn't even eat it.  There was nothing good to say about this visit, and though it is right around the corner, we will not be back.
