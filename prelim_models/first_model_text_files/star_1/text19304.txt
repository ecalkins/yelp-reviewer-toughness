Bowling lane wouldn't register score, and it took us asking three different employees to fix it before anything was done. After 30 minutes of waiting around with no help and condescending comments, we asked for a refund. We were first denied and told us he would seek out the senior manager. Another 10 minutes pass before someone in my group got up to confront management themselves. They told our group the refund would take 3-5 business days. We still haven't been refunded and it's been 8 business days! So many other options, don't go here.
