We had not been in several months, and came in tonight, ordered our usual chicken teriyaki, ginger salmon dinner, hamachi sushi. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? First, they have raised their prices about 25%!! That was a shock, but... More importantly: the food quality has tanked to disreputable levels. Clearly the food purveyors have been downgraded. The chicken was dried out, inedible, tasted old. The salmon was now the cheapest farmed color tinted salmon. Even the rice was hard and dried out. I took a chance and ate one piece of hamachi. They have lost their liquor license, lost much of their staff. However, the two staff members that served us tonight were warm and caring. They deserve to work in a much higher quality environment. This is a case study in how not to run a restaurant. Whoever has bought this place has no  respect for his patrons. Stay away.
