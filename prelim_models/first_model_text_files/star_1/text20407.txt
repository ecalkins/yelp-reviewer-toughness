We ordered food after waiting for 20 minutes just for our drinks. Our server was named Rachel and she couldn't even smile at us. Two other girls were working and there was only two other people in the whole restaurant so it wasn't like it was busy. My wifes fries were cold and soggy . My beer was empty for the rest of our stay. I wanted another beer but Rachel was to busy talking with her co workers. An hour into our meal a guy came out of the kitchen and asked how our food was. I asked for some new fries for my wife and he did. ( this was or only good part of our visit) my wife had to ask him for another shirley temple while or server Rachel just chit chatted . Not once did she check on us or see if everything was ok. Very disappointed in our visit. We will not be back to this establishment.  What a waste of money and time! I should have listened to my wife and gone across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings.
