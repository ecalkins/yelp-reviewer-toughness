0	"Context: I went for dinner on a weekend night with my family. We ordered an assortment of appetizers and curries, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This was my third visit to Aroma in the last 12 months.

Pros: Reservation was easily available on a Saturday night for a large group. The restaurant seemed fairly busy. Downtown location is easily accessible.

Cons: The food quality was mediocre. Portion sizes were small for the price. The service was surprisingly slow compared to my previous visits.

Will I return? Probably not. 

Disclaimer: All member of my family are born and raised in India and are well aware of authentic Indian flavours."
