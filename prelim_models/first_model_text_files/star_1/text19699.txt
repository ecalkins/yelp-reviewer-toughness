The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's,  and assortment of other creatures.  The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole.   If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere...

Long Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL.  I ordered boneless chicken wings.  They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up.  I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock.  The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  

The Costco style tables were filthy.  My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at.

If you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend."
