My drink is a bit on the complicated side. I order a Venti cinnamon dolce latte with 4 shots of espresso, breve and no whip. I've never had a barista question my order, aside from the typical,  ""hot or iced?"" Today, however, was the best I've ever had, ""is that all?"" With sarcastic laughter. Followed with, ""that will be $6.53."" I thought this was on the questionable side, because my drink is normally close to $8.00. For $8.00 a drink, it looks like I'm now also paying for sarcastic rude entertainment. The barista continues on with her rude behavior at the window. I was never greeted. I hear one employee talking to the other questioning my drink, followed by, ""charge him for the breve."" She finally comes to the window and says, ""$7.83"" I hand her my card. Still, no type of customer service.  

I finally get my drink, and thank her. She STILL SAYS NOTHING!! I thank her, and get nothing. Where is the customer service??? Is this place a ghetto franchise? 

I will never return to this location. I work in real estate and will spread the word.  HORRIBLE customer service! I wish I could give zero stars. Such a shame."
