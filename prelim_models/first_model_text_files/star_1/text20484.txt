When we arrived, the hostess had no idea that we had a reservation. We were finally taken to the back room where there were 4 individual tables set up to hold 10 people each. I had requested place settings for 20 and hoped to have one large table, but our group had to split up. We sat down to find the full menu in front of us and when I went and spoke to the manager about our condensed 4 course menu, she said they placed the wrong menus down. I already felt upset that I had confirmed this appointment 2 times and it was not put together, but tried not to let it ruin my experience. Our server was all over the place and should NOT have been waiting on a private party. One of our guests had to ask multiple times for an item because it had been continuously forgotten. The delicious bread with oil and pepper everyone is talking about did not happen; we were given bread and there was olive oil bottles on the table, but no plates, no pepper, nothing. We were each suppose to receive an appetizer, instead they brought out one of each kind for the table to share. Overall, the service and ""lack of communication"" (words from the manager herself) really turned this dinner into an unorganized and stressful night."
