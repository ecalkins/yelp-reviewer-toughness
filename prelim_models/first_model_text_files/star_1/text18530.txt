The first time I ordered eggs and I also tried the pancakes. The eggs were actually the worst I have had in a few years. The pancakes were very dry. The only reason I went back is because I live close and I did not try their signature item, the oven baked pancake.....

....which requires 30 minutes to be cooked. So after waiting 50-60 minutes for a freaking pancake I realized I was right the first time I came here. Not only was there nothing special about my order, but it wasn't any good. If the pancake was good it would have made up for the wait, but it didn't. 

I am not knocking anyone else, but I think people who really enjoyed this place just need to get out to some other breakfast spots."
