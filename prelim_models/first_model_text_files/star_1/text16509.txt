For this review, I will be focusing on the customer service that I received from JOHN at the register.  John works the register and is also the person who comes outside before they open, and shouts on his megaphone to both inform and excite the crowd.  After placing my $526 to go order, I was ready to pay.  After paying with my credit card, John looked at the register Ipad screen, shook his head, and then made a loud and noticeable tisk remark.  He started aggressively bagging the rest of my food, carried it to an open table, and slammed it down.  It made a loud thud onto the table and he quickly walked away.  My friend who was behind me in line, paid for his food (also a to go order of similar size) right after me.  John bagged up his order, carried his order to the table beside my food, and gently placed it down on the table.  He then said to my friend, ""Thank you so much for leaving such a very generous tip!  It goes to everyone here who is working hard for the customers.""  He said so in an exaggerated manner and very loud, to make sure that I heard him.  I really wish I had called him out on his unprofessional, immature behavior right then and there, but unfortunately I didn't.  I have never, ever, felt so disrespected at a restaurant as I was by John.  I will be contacting the owner and general manager to inform them of how I was treated by John.  It is very upsetting to me that I would spend as much money as I did, just to walk away disrespected, angry, and disappointed."
