The problem was of the burgers taste like they have been done in the steamer and then really warmed up or just straight up cooked in the steamer. There was no char or flame flavor.

The poutine gravy was barely edible and the cheese was terrible.  

You're better off saving your money and buying a package of beef jerky for the flight."
