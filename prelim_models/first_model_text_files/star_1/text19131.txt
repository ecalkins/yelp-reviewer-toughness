Today I waited more than 30 minutes for a bowl of pho and if we didn't have asked the workers, we wouldn't have even gotten our bowl. They completely forgot about us, the couple next to us had to even flag one of the workers down for us when they paid for their meal and that couple got there after us. Ended up getting the pho to go when they finally served it to us after letting the server know. Almost missed my flight because of this incident. Ugh
