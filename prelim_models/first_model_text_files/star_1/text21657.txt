I went to the restaurant and ordered letting them know that on cheeseburger absolutely no sauces as my girlfriend is allergic to it.  I ordered protein stle burger along with 2 orders of sweet potato tots.   Sweet potato tots were not crisp and there is sauces on my girlfriends cheeseburger.   When I called about the sauce they said they will make a new one and I could come and pick it up.  My friend is recuperating from a surgery and she didn't want me to leave again.   It was not worth the drive.
