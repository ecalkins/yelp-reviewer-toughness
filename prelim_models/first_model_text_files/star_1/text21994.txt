We thought, wow this is going to excellent.  15 minutes later the waiter came back to take out drink order and let us know he would be back to take our order and go over the menu.  It took 10 more minutes to get our drinks and after being there for 40 minutes our dinner order was finally taken. We ordered the coach's special which was a 4 oz fillet, a lobster tail and asparagus along with a cup of Lobster bisque.  The bisque came out within 5 minutes and was absolutely wonderful and we thought maybe this was worth the wait.  Our meal was brought out and our steaks were overcooked, my lobster was very bitter.  My husbands was lobster was good.  Not one time during our meal did our waiter come over and ask how our meal was.  We left the restaurant 1 hour and 20 minutes after arriving and left completely let down.  The restaurant was not packed at all, in fact it had many empty tables.  I have searched everywhere to find a place to contact Ditka's directly and have been unable to find a way.  I am not attempting to get a free meal as I will not be going back and I am not trying to be reimbursed.  I do feel that Ditka's should know just how horrible the food and service was.
