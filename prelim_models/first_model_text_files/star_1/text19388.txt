They had cashed the deposit check so they quickly threw together a large, unoccupied  party room. Our party was for 10 children. They put a table cover on one table turned on some lights (not all) and left the other tables bare, (tacky). They had one person assigned to the party (I expected at minimum 2). The kids games were combined with another family that was there. As a result, they were not able to play all of the games together due to of lack of space. After hustling around to get the room, they informed us the pizza oven had been out of order for 2 days and there would be a delay in getting the pizza! Early into the party the teenage planner came in and offers a 10% discount. Yes you heard me, they did not have the party scheduled, they did not have enough space, they did not have the pizza, the list goes on and they offered a %10 discount!
 I left after an hour and promised myself, I will give this rendition of the first hour of my granddaughter's birthday party to Yelp."
