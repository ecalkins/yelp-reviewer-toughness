I love fresh sashimi and sushi but the fish here seemed to be sitting out a bit too long and getting dried out.  Maybe this buffet doesn't get busy enough for the chefs to bring out fresh food constantly..it was pretty slow for a Friday night. Please! Play some music! It was so quiet and weird ambience..the out door patio is nice but is just for looks, serves no purpose.
