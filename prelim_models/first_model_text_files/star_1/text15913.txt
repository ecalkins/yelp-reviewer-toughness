For a buffet they had limited options for lunch which wasn't bad because the quality was good.
However I am rating this one stars because this place is to be avoided for lunch during the weekdays because it can get crowded. You have to excuse everyone at your table and around you if you want to have some new items from the buffet.

They should reduce the number of tables and maybe increase the price. It left a bad taste."
