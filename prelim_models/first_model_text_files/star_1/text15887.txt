We were a group of over 20 people. Quite big for a small space, share with other patrons.  We were near the end, until I looked up at the ceiling. Behold - a giant roach crawling on the ceiling.

I never made a mention to the group - imagine the chaos. However I emailed the restaurant about my concern. Even attached pictures I took.  Josh - responded back with apologies.  In the email, he mentioned ""come back, and I will take care of you"".

A year later, I emailed back Josh asking about how he will take care of us. The group was thinking of returning for this year's luncheon.

Josh never responded back. Radio silence.

Haven't return since."
