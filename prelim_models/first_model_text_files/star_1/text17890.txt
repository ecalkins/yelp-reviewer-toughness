When I finally got called in and my son was in the bathroom they denied us a seating and when we asked again to be seated they said: ""No breakfast for you""... It was funny and sad to see a business acting in such an arrogant way towards their customers. We left gladly across the street to ""The US Egg"" with no wait, better food and better service."
