so we decided only to have dessert and yes!! the waiter who has no manners what a customer needs, said. we don't serve desserts only ! excuse me!! is there a rule book you cant jump to desserts! plus u are not even a category of fine dining! so if u don't want business just shut the damn place down.. if u are doing a lunch buffet of 12$  in the afternoon u are surely not fine dining !!

horrible service!! being an indian i would say food is ok, but am I running out of choices... will never go there again !!"
