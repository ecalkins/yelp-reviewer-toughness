Service was quick and super friendly! That makes the experience so much more fun. 

Pizza's are well sized but a bit oily. I guess it works out for the drunks, but it made the pizza a bit messy and the cheese would easily slide off the bread. 

You could order single slices or full. There's some standing room inside and seating outdoors if you want to hang."
