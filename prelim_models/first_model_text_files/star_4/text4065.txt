They really should just put a filtered water station in the corner. Would go here every trip to Vegas but the trek to Cosmo (even though we were actually very close) and the wait time deterred us from going on our last trip. Love that you can pick your own ingredients and really like their dough, sauce and cheese preparations. Selection of toppings is reasonably good and of quality. Overall a must-try if you can tolerate the crazy lineups. Can order whole pies ahead and pick up as alternative.
