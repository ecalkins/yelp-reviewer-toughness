But the workers are super cool, the location is awesome, ON THE 3RD FLOOR OF the cosmo towards the shops and restaurants sign and just look out for a wall full of records like a collage almost and you'll see it. Or just a bunch or ppl eating pizza you can just ask them. Hahah but the pizza is bomb. 




The end"
