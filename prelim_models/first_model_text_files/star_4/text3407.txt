They use great quality cheese and tomato sauce and you can get whatever toppings you'd like.  Order by the slice to expedite the order.  Not cheap, but then nothing is in Las Vegas.  Oh yes, blot out a little oil on top with a napkin, the best tasting pizza somehow always have a little more oil on the surface than my stomach can handle. My favorite feature of this place is that it is open till 4am on weekdays and 5 am on the weekends!
