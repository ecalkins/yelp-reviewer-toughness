This place is really good the flautas where amazing and the beans and rice are authentic only drawbacks are the non traditional chips which are not that good and our server only came around once to check on us. And if your Mexican the lack of real Mexican music might piss you off lol no mariachi, banda or norteno only rock en Espa√±ol from south America, it's like if you go to a bbq joint and there playing Techno it's just not the right music lol
