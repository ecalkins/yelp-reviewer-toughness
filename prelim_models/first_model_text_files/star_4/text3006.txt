No sign points you to it except for the giant line. The hallway is stacked with Italian album covers. Who cares about all this?

The pizza. Just get whatever piece of pie you want, you won't regret it. The mushroom pizza, sausage and peppercini and the cheese were all freakin tasty as hell. The cheese pizza was probably the best.

It's worth the line. That's all you need to know."
