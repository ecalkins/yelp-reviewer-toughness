After the mess it took to check into our hotel, find our reservation, get to our room, etc., all we wanted to do was sleep but we were hungry and only had a limited time in Vegas to explore so we hit up this place. 

Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo across from the night club. Just look for all the drunk people stumbling toward this place and a narrow hallway with vintage records on the wall. 

Inside, this place is super tiny but the staff keeps you entertained with grand shows of spinning pizza dough etc. We were tired but fully awake after their friendly banter. Pizza isn't cheap but then again Vegas isn't exactly cheap so be prepared to pay $5 a slice. We each got the supreme with a variety of meats. Drinks are also expensive so we opted for water. 

Overall, there's a great selection of pizzas (and seasonings!) and you can see them being made fresh. It's open late for all your cravings."
