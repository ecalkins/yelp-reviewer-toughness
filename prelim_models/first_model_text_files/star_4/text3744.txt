But they way it tastes...it has the authentic pizza taste compared to big chains such as Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc. but you get the point! The line was a little long, but it went by quick. The restaurant is kind of hidden so be on the lookout for it. Located on the 3rd floor inside of The Cosmopolitan!
