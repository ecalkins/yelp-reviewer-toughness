Don't tell anybody but it's located on the top floor right next to the elevator, across from the pool table and awesomely weird chairs. 

You see a dark hallway with one of those secret looking wall doors that is wide open, almost as if you were going back in time to those old school pizza places, you see a couple of pin ball machines and thus you have finally arrived at the secret pizza's of all pizzas. 

Order the White pizza with ricotta cheese and mozzarella and only this. It is one of the most greasy, delicious,  white looking pizzas that I have ever tasted, 

And yeah haha it doesn't really have a name btw or a sign or something that will imply that it's located there. At first I thought it was called Secret Pizza but then when my cousin asked a bartender ""where's the secret pizza was located at?"" He gave us a weird look and said no such thing existed lol so we felt stupid until he told us about a pizzeria upstairs."
