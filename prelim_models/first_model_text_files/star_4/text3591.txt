We were lucky enough to stroll right up to the counter and order.  Think we both had two slices each, a beer and a soda for 31 bucks.  The guy behind me had a slice of pizza that looked absolutely divine.  The guy who took our order was genuinely friendly and helpful and was able to get me a refill on my diet coke under fire. There is very limited room to sit or even stand and eat yo' pizza, a lot of folks took it down the hall into the lobby, a clue to those looking for this place.  It's pretty easy to find, right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill and the P3Studio.  I actually liked that they took the pizza and reheated it in the oven, didn't take too long, but I can see if there was a long line.
