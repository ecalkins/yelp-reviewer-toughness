An honest to goodness pizza joint with a crunchy crust, delicious toppings and big slices to absorb the night's libations is exactly what the strip needed.... and you can tell by the line.

$5-$6 for a slice. 30-40 minute wait on the weekends after the clubs get out. 

Vegas needs more great, affordable food on the strip. By my count it's Earl of Sandwich and this Secret Pizza. ...which isn't so secret anymore.

There are no signs for this secret pizza joint. Just walk around aimlessly saying ""Pizza?"" Pizza?"" every dealer and security guy will point you in the right direction.

The Secret is out and I  have a new go-to-joint in Vegas for quick cheap eats."
