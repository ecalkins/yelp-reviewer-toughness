The perfect late night munchies after going to Marquee or just out in Vegas. It's a narrow hallway with a bunch of pictures on the side. No sign or anything but if you see a long line and people coming out with slices, you're in the right area.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5. The only reason I'm putting this is that if it is busy, be prepared to wait a good 45 minutes to an hour for a slice. Especially for boxes. Went on a Monday night at 4AM and only waited about 15 minutes. 

WHY I DOCKED IT: The only thing to ruin the experience was we ordered a box of white pizza and they said it'd be 10-15 minutes. So we walked around and came back in about 10 and waited for our pizza. Our pizza was already DONE and the two cashiers who helped us didn't even bother to tell us they were done. A guy that was cooking the pizzas had to ask why we were just standing there. How are you that lazy to tell us our pizza is done? Unless your memory is that bad, what's your excuse? Worst service so shout out to the two ladies that were there chillin' at the register and not bother to tell us our pizza was done for another 15 minutes.

PRICE:
$5.50 per slice
$28 for a box

WHITE PIZZA: 5/5. White sauce is the best sauce. On anything. Alfredo sauce with a bunch of cheese is what this baby is made of. Love the globs of ricotta and it's thin pizza too! The crust isn't the greatest but still amazing.

OVERALL: 4/5. Go for the food, not the service.
OH! AND SHOUTOUT TO THE GUY WHO DIDN'T EVEN HELP US AND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN WE WERE JUST STANDING THERE WAITING AND ASKED US IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING. IF HE DIDN'T ASK, WE WOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN OUR PIZZA. YOU DA REAL MVP!"
