The bar offered NFL game time happy hour with really delicious margaritas for the price and the food was delicious.  Our waitress was really nice and the restaurant was very well decorated.  There was a nice little patio area which we would enjoy relaxing and eating at on a normal day, but we were interested in the game at that time.  Great place, would go back again!

P.S. Happy hour special is only at the bar."
