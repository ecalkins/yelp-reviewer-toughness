The workers were really nice, espeically considering how hard and fast they were working b/c of the huge crowd. 

I love that they offer free water! The sodas were $4 for a solo cup size but the nice cold water fit the bill to wash down my slice. 

I wish I'd waited for my slice to cool a bit before I went after it. It was so fresh and hot that picking it up caused the toppings to slide around. I went folded style and it was greasy good. 

I'll try it again next time and chill out for a minute while it cools!"
