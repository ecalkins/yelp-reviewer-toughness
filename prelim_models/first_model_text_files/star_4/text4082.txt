The first time I came here I wasn't sure if I'd like the food and plus it was a Friday night, at least the wait wasn't too long (about 20 min) and hey it was happy hour. 

When we sat down, the server approached us and introduced herself and took our drink orders. I wasn't too sure what to try because they all seemed delicious. I ended up ordering the Ribeye Tacos...YUM! My cousin ordered the tamales and I had a little sample...totally worth trying.

The second time I came here I tried the Quesa Tacos because the server said it was one of the best items on the menu and I wouldn't be let down. He was right!! I ordered the Quesa Tacos with carne asada with a side of queso rice; I totally recommend trying it and trust me you can probably share because the tacos are pretty filling and the rice is amazing. 

The third time I came here I tried the shrimp tacos (grilled), yeah I don't recommend it at all just because it was salty and just not that great. However, my cousin ordered the Empanadas and had a little bite of it and it was really good. 

BTW if you check if you get a free fried ice cream, so make sure you check in and show your server because dessert is a perfect way to end your meal."
