It's something about that cheese that makes me want to come back for me. I definitely like the pizzas with the pizza sauce more than the white pizza, but the white pizza is pretty good as well. Definitely coming back to try some more flavors :). 

Is it worth the price though? Mmmm not really since it's 5 dollars per slice, but what can you expect? It's Vegas."
