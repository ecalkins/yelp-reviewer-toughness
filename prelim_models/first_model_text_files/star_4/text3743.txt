Ironic that the place is called Secret Pizza, because if the line at 3am is any indication, someone just told everyone about this place. Luckily, both times I went we beat the rush... or should I say set the trend (since a huge line formed right behind us both times hehe). I've had two types of pizza here the White Pizza and two item combo of Sausage and Pepperoni. The White Pizza is my fave, its toppped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and we usually add sausage to it. I like how there is absolutely no advertisement of the place on the Cosmopolitan website. But I guess they try to keep it a secret for those who have yet to find it. I have to admit, it was quite an accomplishment when we stumbled upon secret pizza.
