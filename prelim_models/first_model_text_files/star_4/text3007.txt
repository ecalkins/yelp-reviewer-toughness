--I was very pleased with my two slices of this pizza. It was a bit on the greasy side, so I dabbed a bit of oil on the provided napkins. The white sauce was very creamy, and I enjoyed the combination of mushrooms and sausage a lot! The amount of cheese was just right, not too much and not too little. The crust didn't make much impression, but I still ate it."
