[[ Location ]]-- 3rd floor in Cosmo, right outside the Marquee exit and next to some Japanese restaurant. Basically, get in that giant line you see going down a hallway.

[[ Slices ]]-- Pick your slice for $5 and I would suggest you get at least 2 so you won't have to wait in line again. If you want a whole Pie, you'll most likely wait another 45 mins for it to be done. 
    ++ White Pizza: mozzarella, ricotta, and garlic. WOW blew my mind! DELICIOUS and super cheeesssyy which is the way it should be.
    ++ Sausage and Ricotta
    ++ Pepperoni
    ++ Mushroom

I think everything is pretty basic but it's perfect if you're looking for a NY-ish thin sliced pizza that's always piping hot and hits the spot!"
