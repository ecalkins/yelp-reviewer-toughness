It's easy to walk past since there's is no signage, no door and it barely even smells! But you know you're close when you see phantom pizza slices on paper plates wandering around. 

There usually is a line, so expect a wait, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. This is largely because your options are somewhat limited: Cheese, Bianca, Pepperoni, Supreme, Meatlovers. Though you do have the ability to add your own toppings for a charge and can buy by the slice (~5.00+) or by the pie. For a group, definitely order a whole pie...and don't forget the napkins, cuz you'll need 'em! 

It's not the greatest pizza in the world, but it's still delicious and reasonably priced! The fun is in finding/knowing the location and it's just about the only place in the Cosmo where you can get a late (or late-late) night munchie without the fuss of sit-down table service. In fact, seating is very limited...a few high top stools and that's about it. So, unless you can snag the couches directly across from the entrance, you're better off going back to your room, or around the corner (towards the convention hall) and sitting there to snack."
