It was past midnight on a Saturday night and the line wasn't getting shorter as we stood in it. People were passing by us with either slices of pizza or a full on box with a whole pie in it. 

When you get to the front of the line, you kinda ignore the menu that they have and just point out the ones that you like. Come to think of it, I think their menu just states the prices and some options but that's all I could remember. In any case, you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you. Each slice is about $5-$6. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious. The boyfriend had his the next day.  We heated it up and it was still pretty good. But it's definitely better if it was eaten the same day it was ordered. 

In any case, I would brave the line again and order their other options. It's a pretty good slice of pizza."
