That being said-it is very good pizza and a good value. It is small inside and the decor very much reminds me of a typical pizza joint in Queens from years gone by. I especially like the stools and pinball machines. 

It's fun to enjoy east coast pizza in Las Vegas and I recommend dinning at Secret Pizza at least once. It will make you feel like you are back in Queens!"
