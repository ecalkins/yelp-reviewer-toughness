Granted, the majority of folks at 2am are probably just as buzzed as we were coming from the nearby clubs in the Cosmo, but that didn't stop me from walking to this spot & ordering 2 slices. The only thing that messed up my pizza was me. I thought I grabbed the parmesan cheese shaker and instead grabbed the garlic one. If you know about parmesan shakers, you're aware it takes some serious shakes to get it going... not the case with garlic. No worries, I used the napkins to get most of it up and downed them both. I wasn't a big fan of the red cups for fountain drinks but I should have asked about a refill (not sure if they do them or not) but you gotta head out into the atrium to grab a nearby custom wood-worked table to park your rear & enjoy."
