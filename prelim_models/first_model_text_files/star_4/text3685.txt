This is a MUST GO if you like authentic NY style pizza.  Get either the regular slice or the ""white"" pizza. Both are my favorite. The other ones with toppings are just okay... The slices are huge and are 2 are more than enough to fill you up. 

I love the fact that this place is small, not overly crowded and the guys behind the counter heat up your slice and hand it to you to eat. It really is that good.

The prices are decent... $5/slice is not horrible.

Just remember... it's on the 3rd Floor fo"
