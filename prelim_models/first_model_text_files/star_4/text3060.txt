For about $4 a slice it is pretty reasonable. It is NY style pizza so it's large and thin. I thought it was okay, not the best but for the price in Vegas makes it a lot better. They do charge you just as much for a red solo cup for pop which is a little ridiculous, but I guess anywhere for drinks is pretty pricey for the most part.

If you're in the neighborhood I would stop by but wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find this place as I saw lots of equally delicious looking pizzas on the Strip."
