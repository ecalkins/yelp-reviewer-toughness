So I was looking for great pizza and turned to Yelp for advice and as always they were right about the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan. 

When you go to The Cosmopolitan there are absolutely no advertisements for this place. Some people like to search the Casino, but I cheated and ask someone that works at the hotel. (I would say the location, but that would give away all of the fun of looking for it. Read another review for the location. 

By the guy's expression, you feel apart of a special club of people who know about the Pizzeria. 

I had a peperoni, sausage and green pepper slice that was amazing. It is just the perfect combination of sauce, cheese, and crust. 

Next time I am in the hankering for a slice, I'll come here."
