Though the line wasn't too bad (I came here for lunch), the price for a slice of pizza was a pretty penny. I think ~$5-6 for a slice is a bit pricey, but ordering the whole pizza isn't that much cheaper either, considering the # of toppings.

The texture of my pizza was crispy and thin, I loved it. I ordered the combo slice with all the toppings. Overall, it was delicious, and a great place to stop by with friends."
