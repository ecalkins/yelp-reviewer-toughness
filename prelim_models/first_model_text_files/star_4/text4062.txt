The white pizza was nice and garlicy.  The mushroom pizza needed something to give it a bit more kick.  The crust on both pizza were crispy thin.  $5 a slice was a little steep,  I would like to see them offer some sort of combo meal including a drink but maybe most people just order whole pizzas and take them back to thier room.  The staff wasn't super friendly - I asked what kind of pizza they had by the slice and the cashier just pointed to the pizzas.  I had to ask again for her to tell me the toppings.  Service was quite fast.
