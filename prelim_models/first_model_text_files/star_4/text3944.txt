It was a decent slice for $6, but I think the ""hidden"" location is what keeps business up, and not necessarily some ridiculously amazing pizza. Tried both the Mushroom and the White Pizza. Tasty, self-explanatory ingredients on both. Warmed up and served out of the oven similar to Sbarro's. Won't be going so far out of my way to grab a simple slice of NY-style pizza, but they've definitely earned a spot in the back of my mind should I stay at the Cosmo or wander through during the wee hours..."
