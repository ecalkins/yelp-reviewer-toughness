We tried to call to order a pie but I guess by this time they were super busy that it was not going to happen. But it was worth the wait, once we got there the staff was friendly and was out right away. We got the a slice of pep, combo and one that i don't know the name so I just refer to it as Fluffy Pizza. They were good, I cant complain. Its Vegas Pizza what do you expect, but this place was good I  definitely would not mind waiting in line again, plus its open 24 hours.  (Greasy, definitely Greasy)
