Yes, it is ""just"" above average pizza (it's Vegas!).  Yes, it is not a secret anymore and there are often lines, and yes, it still is hard to find even after coming here several times (maybe it's just me).  

With all that said, I keep coming back and there is something to be said for that.  What? I don't know.  I kind of expect to pay higher than average when in Vegas so I'm ok with it.  I also kind of expect to wait in line from time to time.  Maybe my coping skills are better than some other reviewers.  But, back to the food.  It's just above or slightly above average pizza.  But after a few drinks or a big win at the tables, and it is a slice from the gods.  After a loss at the tables, its the only thing to eat because there isn't much around cheaper or more convenient.  I would say they have a great business model!

Pros: convenient (if you are in Cosmo), relatively inexpensive, not bad quality, can feed you on your last $5 after taking a beating at the tables. 

Cons: kind of overpriced for what it is. I hate trying to find this place. 

Overall.  It doesn't matter what I say, or whether I like it or not.  If I'm staying at the Cosmo again, I'll be back.  If not, maybe not.  Love their concept though, and the guys working there have always been cool as heck."
