I'm not sure about ""best in the US,"" but the pizza is very good. It's served in big, floppy slices with a buttery crust, spicy sausage and pepperoni, and fresh veggies. Vegas priced at $6 a slice, but still worth it. They also have thick Sicilian style slices we didn't get to try... it's very good pizza at 6pm, but I'd imagine it tastes 10x better at 2am."
