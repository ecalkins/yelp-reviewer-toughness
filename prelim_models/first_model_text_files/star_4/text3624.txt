Food:
I ordered the pizza by the slice that included ricotta, sun dried tomatoes, and meatball.

The pizza looked like it had been sitting out for a long time and they threw it back in the oven to re-heat, but it still tasted really good! I was expecting some mediocre pizza that had been sitting out, but I was pleasantly surprised how good it was!

Sides Notes

Ambiance:
There's not really much of a d√©cor. It's small and there may be about seven bar seats.

Service:
The service was average.

Overall:
If you're looking for pizza in Vegas, this is the place to check out."
