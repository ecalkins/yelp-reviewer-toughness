Next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi restaurant on the 3rd floor, there is a hallway decorated with old album covers.  Walking down this hallway will lead you to the pizzeria.  You can order an entire pizza or get a previously prepared pizza by the slice.  You can also add toppings to a slice of cheese pizza and they'll warm it up and blend in the extra toppings.  They have PBR and Dogfish 90 beer on tap.  The restaurant is inexpensive and the pizza is delicious.  The pizzeria is sparsely decorated with a few chairs, a pinball machine and some stand up bar tables to eat your pie.  This is the best place I've been to on the strip to order a quick inexpensive slice of pizza.  The employees are very helpful with good advice on what to order.  Pizzeria ambiance-3 stars, Food-4 stars, Strip Value-5 stars, Service-5 stars.
