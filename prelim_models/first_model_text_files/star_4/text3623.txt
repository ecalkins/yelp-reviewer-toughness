Sober or otherwise, I always stop by here for a great slice of pizza and honestly it is SO worth it. Depending on what time you go, the line can either be super short or out the door. Either way, you won't regret coming here.

As the name suggests, the location of it is a little secret. That is, you really have to know where you're going or you'll easily walk by it. To be honest, the easiest way to get there is to go to Marquee nightclub and then take the glass elevator up to the third floor. When the elevator doors open, Secret Pizza will be to your immediate right. (If someone knows of a quicker way to get here please let me know!)

My personal favorite here is the white pizza which has alfredo sauce and a variety of cheeses for toppings, but if you're lucky I definitely recommend the deep dish Sicilian pizza--is it TO DIE FOR!!

The cost of a slice can vary from $5 and upwards and you can expect to wait a couple minutes if you order a whole pizza as well (but can you blame them? Its fresh)!

One note: they do offer complimentary water but after a certain hour into the evening they stop doing so.
