The food, delightful,  very good for Mexican food,  ordered carne asada (a little overpriced,  $16.99),  margaritas (it gets better by the glass) and their street tacos (I had carne asada and carnitas)was very good, very well seasoned. 
If you are a margarita connoisseur, try one, you'll thank me later (if you remember).
I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys traditional Mexican food,  with an authentic flavor.
Oh,  did I mentioned their margaritas?"
