0	The name is unknown! It's literally a hidden pizza place in the Third level of the cosmopolitan by the pool tables before the sushi restaurant. The hallway is decorated with records and then you will see the pizza place! It's pricey about $5/ slice and 26+ for one whole pizza. It was good New York style, a little too thin and crispy for me but it was still good! They are big slices.
