It was neat to be able to grab a slice at a drunken hour to get some energy for the next adventure. Slices were reasonably priced, if you want to sit down to eat there are a handful of barstools inside the pizza joint, but there are also chairs to sit on the second floor. 

The pizza - it was okay. We got pepperoni and vegetarian. I think our mistake was not trying the white sauce pizza. I am guessing that is what all the raves are about. Next time I will try the white sauce pizza."
