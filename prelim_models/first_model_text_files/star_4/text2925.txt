That said, I acknowledge only 4 pizzerias in the country that are worthy of the ""NYC Style"" moniker. Pucci's in South Beach, Miami... Cazzola's in Coral Gables, Miami, Pin Up Pizza in Las Vegas and this. It's fun just trying to find this place. You'll know what i mean when you go there. It's open 

That's it. No reason to eat pizza anywhere else. ESPECIALLY CHICAGO!"
