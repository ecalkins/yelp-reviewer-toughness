Ok, so this is a good pizza place hidden in a really nice hotel. But, its AMAZING after partying all night when you want a bite before calling it.

Pro Tip: If you have a group, call in ahead of time and order for a full pizza and don't wait in the line!!! BOOM :-D 

It's a little hard to find during the day since it's a small hallway on the Ballroom floor next to the tube elevator and pool table. But it's a whole lot easier later in the night since EVERYONE even remotely around the hallway is eating pizza. Just ask them where it's at :-) Night time wait is around 20 min but you can get in pretty quick during the day.

The pizza itself is really good. It's a New York style pizzeria with thin crust pizza and a display of pizzas that you can choose form."
