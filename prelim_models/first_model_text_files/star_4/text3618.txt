It's cute, though. No sign, cute little hallway, album covers on the wall... 

I got a slice of white pizza and even though it was good (albeit being on the thin and floppy side), I needed more variety than garlic all the way. I suggest trying different toppings as well.

There was no wait when we went, but it was early on a weeknight. Might as well go for the novelty of it. The place could use more seating, but what I liked most is that it felt like just a casual pizza joint. You're just grabbing a relaxing bite to eat. No pretentiousness that goes along with a lot of other things in Vegas."
