The pizza is fantastic but it is always extremely crowded. The prices fluctuate. The best deal is to order a pie but with wait times of 90 minutes or more, we passed. There are a variety of single slices with different toppings. Due to the crowd they are constantly making pizza so it is extremely fresh. The hours are phenomenal, but are dangerous for a pizza addict like myself. Proceed with caution:)
