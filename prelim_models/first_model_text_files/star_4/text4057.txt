We got lucky as far as timing goes because the line quickly picked up after we got there. I ordered a cheese slice and it was delicious hot and fresh.
The only complaint I had was the wait time. It was pretty long considering that almost everyone was ordering pizza I would have expected to move swiftly. Hey, I got my slice and that's what counts."
