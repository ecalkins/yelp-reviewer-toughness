Best story about this place, a few friends and myself decided to get some pizza around midnight, and a few girls were coming out of Marquee. They see us eating pizza at a table in front of one of the other restaurants on this level and come up to us asking where we got this pizza. I point over to the general direction of the hallway that leads to the pizzeria, and she just gives me this look and says, ""Are you sure you didn't get it from here?"" pointing to the restaurant behind me, which is CLEARLY closed with the bars down and the servers counting down the registers. I'm pretty sure I did NOT get this pizza from a closed restaurant..."
