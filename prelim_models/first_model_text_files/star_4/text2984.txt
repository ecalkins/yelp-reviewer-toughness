The slices are large and are perfect to fold in half.  The sauce had a nice balance to it that almost took me back to a small pizza joint in NYC.  

If you are looking for traditional pizza, with no funny toppings or craziness this is the place to go.  You can get it by the slice or a whole pie.  The service is very quick and efficient.  There are a few stools to sit on, but overall limited seating."
