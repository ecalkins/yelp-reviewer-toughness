We were in the Cosmo late and found Secret Pizza. The line was long but it wasn't terrible. While part of me was expecting salty greasy cardboard I had high hopes because of the great reviews- and I wasn't disappointed! 4 stars instead of 5 because there isn't really much seating and the selection of pizza styles was pretty limited if you just want one piece vs an entire pie. While $6 is pretty steep for a slice, it's not bad for a meal in Vegas- especially one that is open so late!
