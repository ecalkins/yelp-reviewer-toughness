0	Secret is great, particularly if you're staying at or happen to by at Cosmo. It's actually pretty easy to find, just follow your nose on the 3rd level. There's usually quite a line (you're better off calling ahead for a whole pie if you or your group plan on eating over 4 slices). The pricing is pretty aggressive but hey, it's Vegas, you would've spent it on worse things.
