0	Hidden in an alley between two larger restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the ideal place for a relatively (relative to longer waits at sit-down restaurants during peak hours) quick bite. They serve up amazing custom pizzas by the slice or the entire pie. Our group came in during dinner time, so the line was pretty long, but customers walking out assured us it was worth the wait. Our group of five people ordered a custom pie, and it was more than enough to feed me and a bunch of hungry boys! We got the white pizza with five toppings, including a unique apple sausage and creamy cheese. Although the pizza is on the greasier side, it's the perfect indulgent pizza you want to find in a city like Vegas. The dough itself is pretty thin, barely enough to hold up all the cheese and toppings. I'm all about the crust, and this was one was baked to perfection with a crispy, charred outside and a doughy, chewy interior. The pizza is extremely generous in size, leaving me more than full after a slice and a half. I definitely recommend this spot to get some gourmet Vegas-worthy pizza on the go!
