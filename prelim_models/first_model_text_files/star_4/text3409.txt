Within 15-20 minutes we were at the counter to order. Crap. They ran outta White Pizza. Another 20 minutes wait. Shoot me. So, my hubs orders the pepperoni and I get the Sicilian. Big mistake on the Sicilian. Thick, bready pizza crust with just a bit of the ""white"" pizza part - which is mozzarella and ricotta I think. However, the pepperoni was super crunchy and chewy and it totally did not say in the middle (hate that). We liked the thin crust pizza we went back for another slice of cheese. Delicious as well and piping hot. Each slice is about $5 after tax."
