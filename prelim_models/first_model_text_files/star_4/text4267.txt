0	We Happened to stumble upon this cozy Mexican restaurant while driving around. I Yelp it and it has good reviews, good price so we went ahead with no hesitation to try it. We got our food in no time and Viola! love at first bite.  Everything tasted fresh and the unique taste just out do the other Mexican  restaurant I had tried. They have put a lot of effort in cooking and preparing the food that you can taste it (you know what I mean.)It  tasted like you really in another country so authentic. Nice ambiance, great service. You are welcomed as soon as you walk in. Overall all it was a great dining experience for my hubby and I. And most definitely be dropping by more often.
