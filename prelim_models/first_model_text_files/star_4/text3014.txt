We had a little bit of trouble finding it because my sister had been there before and we were walking around on the wrong floor too stubborn to ask for help but as soon as we asked someone for help we were pointed in the right direction. 

We were a little put off by the $5/slice pricetag but my dad, sister, and I each ordered a piece. The crust came out perfectly and was so crisp without being burnt. I loved that they had shakers of oregano and garlic powder in addition to the usual red pepper and parmesan cheese. My mom decided not to order a piece but ended up taking multiple bites of all of our pizzas because it was so good! 

If you want a quick cheap snack, I would definitely recommend Secret Pizza!"
