The pizza is New York style and they offer a variety of different types of slices. The pizza was excellent!!! I also ordered a ""veggie salad"" really good !!!!! Pizza was very good, only con is the prices on sodas and such, kind of ridiculous. Like buying a drink at Disneyland! $4.50 for a solo cup of Coke. Also there is no seating so be prepared to stand! Very good for a quick bite !"
