It is in a secret alley but you will notice it is around the corner for milos or the paella place. Just ask around or look for pizza boxes being carried out. The line is long cuz they have to heat it up. I got the meat one with pepperoni and meatballs and the white sauce which is like a creamy delicious one. I really liked each because I needed meat but the white was yelpy. The crust is thin and I devoured 1.5 easy. It cost about $12 or so. It takes about half hour if you are toward the end of the alley and you can sit outside. Make sure to grab napkins cuz you will need it!
