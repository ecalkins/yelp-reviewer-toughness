A plain white or red pizza is $4.50 and add on 50 cents for each topping.  It's expensive but it's great quality and it's one of the cheaper meals on the strip. Their sausage and peperoncini slice was delicious.  The sourness of the pepper cut the savory sausage - a winning combination!  The thin crust is so crunchy and has a nice bite as well.

Enjoy!"
