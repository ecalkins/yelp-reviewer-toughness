And toppings (we had the 3 meat- pepperoni, sausage and meatball) were real sliced meat, not those crappy crumbles you get at some pizza places. After eating one slice, I was asking for a friend to handle the rest. So don't think you will need several slices to get your fill.

Ok, the taste and quality of ingredients would earn this place a 5 star rating with me, but I could only give them 4 stars because there is absolutely no space remotely close to enjoy eating the pizza. I wanted so badly to get that first bite in, and it took forever to find a spot ( down the escalator twice and a random seat in the casino at Cosmopolitan) to eat my pizza. I was so uncomfortable trying to hold my plate and napkins in one hand while folding one slice to eat with the other hand. So my suggestion is to scope out a spot to eat your pizza before you get in line. A pizza this good should be enjoyed immediately and in a comfortable environment. Lastly, I feel their menu is a little overpriced. A whopping $6.25 for a slice with 3 toppings, $4 for a single soda, and $8.00 for a 2 liter of soda, but the good thing is that tax was included."
