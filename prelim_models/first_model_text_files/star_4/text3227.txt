0	Place wasn't easy to find because it really lives up to its name. However we asked and got directed right to it. Pizza is really good and if your getting 3-4 slices it's better to get a whole pie.  Definitely worth the find.  The 4 starts is for pricing and it's really small inside. But still a cool place.
