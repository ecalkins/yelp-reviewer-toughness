Head down the hall full of famous Italians once you get to the third floor and you're on the right track. Once you finally find it, the pizza is quite tasty (my NY born and raised wife approved) and even better after all the effort you made to find it. There wasn't a line on a late night visit during the week and I was able to play a game of pinball while I waited.

Excellent pizza and worth the effort for a quick bite on the strip."
