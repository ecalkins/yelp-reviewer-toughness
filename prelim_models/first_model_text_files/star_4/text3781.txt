My one issue? Secret pizza is not really secret. On Saturday night it took 30 minutes to get through the line, then another 30 ,inutes as my friends and I ordered a whole pizza. At 3am - we were drunk and hungry so this was not happy time.

Granted, it was Saturday on Halloween weekend so maybe it was especially packed. But if you don't want to wait in line, avoid post club hours as everyone from Marquee just makes there way over to Secret Pizza."
