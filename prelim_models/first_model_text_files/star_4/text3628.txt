Even when there's a line, it goes by pretty quickly. The arcade games makes for an interesting atmosphere for the place. There's only standing area in the small restaurant, but there's plenty of seating directly outside in the Cosmo. If you're staying at the Cosmo, it's a great place to go to! 

Rating this 4 stars both for the taste and the bang for buck (especially for Vegas prices)"
