White Pie ($28) - 5 stars. I don't know what's in this pie, but it's damn good. It contains light cheese but still boasts rocking flavors! 

Pepperoni Pie ($26) - 3 stars. Below standard for pepperoni pizza. 

Expect a 20- to 25-minute wait for whole pies. They provide paper plates, parmesan cheese, and pepper. Just ask. We came in around dinner time and there was hardly any wait. I hear the lines can be kind of ridiculous right after clubbing hours. 

Vintage arcade games such as monopoly pinball and original pac-man."
