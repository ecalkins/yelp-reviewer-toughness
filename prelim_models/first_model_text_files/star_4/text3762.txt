You start with a base slice and you can add as many toppings as you want (you pay per topping). They kinda just pile everything on there, so dont get too carried away or it will be difficult to eat. Also, don't be fooled by the selection they have on the counter, because they have a lot more under the table! 

Crispy, hot, and delicious mmmm. While it's a bit steep at $5, I'd still come back here! 
We went around 2 or 3 on a Saturday and there was no wait. WOO! but I hear the line can get pretty long"
