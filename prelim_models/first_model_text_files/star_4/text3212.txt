And although its called secret pizza place it's not really a secret you can ask for directions if you need them. I've had the cheese pizza here and it is really good classic foldable cheesy greasy pizza. However I recently tried the white pizza on the recommendation of a friend and I have to say wow. I had the white pizza with tomatoes and loved it. Big slices still the same grease level and just plain delicious. I will be going with the white pizza from now on. The only thing about this place is its more expensive then your average pizza place but that comes with the territory since it is on the strip. Definitely still recommend it.

The service: the service at this place is really good the staff friendly they can get busy which can sometimes slow things down just depends on the day. You can get slices or a whole pizza. Not a lot of room to sit but you can always walk and eat. Or grab a slice or pie for the room."
