A few months later, I ran across Yelp reviews on Secret Pizza and threw it in his face-I wasn't dreaming it up! So the next visit to the Cosmopolitan, I had to find the pizza. I asked an employee and he looked around, replied in a whisper to tell us how to get there.

It really was a secret. How would anyone know to go down an unmarked hallway? The hallway is pretty sweet-it's lined with pictures of old album covers. The actual pizza joint is pretty small with only a few barstools and counter space but it works because really, how long does it take to eat a slice or two before you're off to gamble again? 

The customer service was great, prices are reasonable and they even have Galaga to play. If you don't know what Galaga is, you probably weren't born during the time it was popular. Anyway, the pizza itself was good but nothing to write home about. The crust is thin but I think what's great about it is that it's not greasy and it's quick and simple so that you can be on your way and get back to gambling, partying and all of the other sinful things you do in Las Vegas."
