0	Secret Pizza is an experience.  Walk through a twilight zone tunnel to transport yourself from a chi chi and expensive Las Vegas casino offering Jose Andre's prices into a New York pizzeria offering pizza by the slice from a dude wearing a Mets baseball cap.  Prices are steeper than in Manhattan, but the experience is very trippy (and gives you an affordable) option to eat.  The pizza is solid.
