I would think that its in the Cosmo hotel that it will be very fancy, artsy and complicated but no its just a little hidden pizza shop that you would find in New York. You can tell it is very fresh, theres only like 3-4 pizzas to choose from. The best thing is the location, right across from the popular Marquee. This type of food is way better than earls sandwiches on a drunk night.
