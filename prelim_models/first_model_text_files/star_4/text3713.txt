The menu is pretty simple, which is basically the pizzas are displayed and you pick whats available.  The sell slices and whole pies.  The price was decent, roughly $5/slice.  It was super yummy, lots of cheese and flavor!

There's no seating inside, thus you'll have to take your pizza and enjoy outside or elsewhere.  Though the pizza was amazingly delicious, not sure if it was worth the almost 1hr wait.  Definitely a must have getting out of the club!"
