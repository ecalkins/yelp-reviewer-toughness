The pizza is very, very, NYC-style, with crispy thin crusts that you can fold, and you can put whatever you like on it, as long as they have it.

This place is not exactly cheap, but definitely much easier on your wallet than the other stuff in the better casinos and hotels. You could go to McDonald's for lunch, but why bother when you have Secret Pizza?"
