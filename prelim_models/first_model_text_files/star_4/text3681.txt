This is a good, no-frills pizza joint that is good for a late night bite. I had a slice of the white pizza, which was very cheesy, large and super-delicious. My partner had the sliced meatball, which was good, but he's had better. Any pizza aficionado has their preferences, so don't expect it to compare to the neighborhood pizza joint you know and love. You go here because it's late, you're tipsy and you need something good and filling to cap off the night. You'd spend probably the same amount at a Sbarro in any of the ubiquitous food courts on the strip, so do yourself a favor and go for the better pizza at Secret Pizza."
