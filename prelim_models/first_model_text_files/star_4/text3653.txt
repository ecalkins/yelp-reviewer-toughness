It's not overly tomato saucy, the cheese was had great flavor and the pepperoni was meaty and fresh and let's not forget the crust....mmmmmm so good til nothing is left in your hands as you chow down on a slice.  Each whole pizza ordered is specifically made for you in 45 minutes to the Tee and it was worth every minute not including the line to wait and order but still worth trying the secret hype.

Yes, it's not a secret but you'll still need to ask where to find this spot because you won't find it since they didn't put a name to this place hoping it was kept a secret exclusively to YELPERS. Hahahahahaa...Jk! 

Great hidden sinister gem in sin city...MUST bookmark."
