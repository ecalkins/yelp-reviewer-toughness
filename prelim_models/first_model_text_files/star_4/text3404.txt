It was my bf and I's first time, so we tried pepperoni, meatball and cheese. Surprisingly cheese was DELICIOUS and my favorite. So is the MEATBALL pizza. I thought it was sausage but it wasn't. lol. They had so much flavor to them. Pepperoni was ok. Not bad but I liked the other 2 more. I will definitely be coming back when I'm back in Vegas. I knocked off a star only because the pizza was extremely greasy. But it was SO GOOD.. Next time we will for sure get a whole box.
