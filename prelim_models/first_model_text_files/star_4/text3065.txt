About half a second later, the wonderful smell of fresh pizza hit my nose and, like a beacon, drew me in.

Compared to the other places on the strip, this place is a dive. It's about as simple as you can get; pizza by the slice or pie, limited drinks (some beer) and red solo cups next to a water cooler. That's about it folks. The prices, though, aren't typical Vegas and certainly about the cheapest you'll find on the strip. I think I paid $6 for a ""slice"" of pizza. I say ""slice"" because this could easily have fed two of us (but it didn't, and I ate the entire thing!)

I'll definitely be coming back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Just keep it quiet.. there's just standing room only at the counter to eat, and I don't want to have to wait for a spot! :)

Enjoy!"
