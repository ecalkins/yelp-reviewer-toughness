Pepperoni was also really good. I had 4 huge slices that night, it was worth all the calories... Hahaha! The staff were super nice too! Tip for the girls: just flirt a bit with them and they'll make your order a tad bit faster! LOL! It's not too bad especially when there's a couple of cute pizza guys there... ;)
