It's sort of hidden in that there's no sign, but on the third floor, you follow your nose down the record-filled hallway between Blue Ribbin and Jaleo.  It's labeled ""Pizza"" on some hotel maps.

Like most stuff in the glitzy part of Las Vegas, it's not exactly cheap, but it is good.  It's also a really small space, and you'll probably want to take your plate back outside ... or up to your room.  The guys behind the counter told us that the crowds tend to come in waves; it'll be perfectly quiet for a while and then suddenly, bam!

Don't think you'll be blown away by it or anything, but hey - it's kind of cool."
