There is no menu, no prices listed.  You just look at the topping selection and create your pizza pie, or order by the slice from the selection laid out.  We ordered a whole pizza (half white with an amazing garlic spread and the other half  was pepperoni, mushroom, onion, and bell peppers).  We waited a while for it because there seemed to be only 1 worker at the time who was assisting other patrons at the same time he was building our pizza.  But, that was OK, because there was a pinball machine to keep me entertained while I waited.  And it was well worth the wait. It totally hit the spot."
