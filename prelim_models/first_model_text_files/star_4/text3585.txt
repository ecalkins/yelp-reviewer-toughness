This Pizza was Garlicky and Cheesy! My two favorite things on Pizza, so I was in Heaven!  The only reason I can't give it 5 Stars is that my girlfriends PBR tasted horrible, like they need to clean their lines.  The place is very small, but there are a few Wheelchair  height spots at the counter.

Secret Pizza will be a must stop on my Vegas trips!"
