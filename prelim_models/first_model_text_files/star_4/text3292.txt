This place really is a secret because there isn't a sign at the front of the restaurant and you can't find it by looking at the hotel's directory, it isn't listed on there.  So everyone who's been here either heard about it by word of mouth or found out about it through Yelp.  You'll completely miss this place if you walk by it.  It's on the second floor of the casino, across from the entrance to Marquee.  Their entrance literally looks like a walkway to an emergency exit or employees only area.  

I had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was delicious.  We got there at 11am right when they opened so the pizzas were freshly out of the oven.  The crust was just the way I like it - thin and crispy w/ a bit of chewiness.  They open till 4 am so if you're craving for some late night grub after Marquee, this would be the place to hit up."
