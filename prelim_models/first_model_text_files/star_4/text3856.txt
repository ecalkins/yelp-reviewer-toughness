The pizza was great.  Besides the drunk annoying people everywhere their pizza was great!!  The crust was perfect not to thick or dry.  The toppings were lay down thick and the cheese and sauce was amazing.  We ordered a whole pizza brought it out to one of the tables and just wen to town.  I must say that's the best pizza I have ever had after a long night in the club.  Try it out guys its worth the wait.
