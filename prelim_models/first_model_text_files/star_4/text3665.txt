The whole ""hidden"" thing still gives it an appealing quality. If you haven't been in yet, it's on the third level across from the pool table lounge area. 

The dark corridor leading into the light of the ""hole in the wall"" pizza joint is a pretty sweet introduction to the place. Slices are pricey, but I doubt the majority of their clientele cares much about that so long as they can feed the drunken hunger. 

The pizza is really good, though, and it won't take long for you to start stuffing your mouth with it after ordering. It seems small, but there's still enough space to work around the crowds when eating your slice and drinking your beer."
