It's always crowded but they do well with getting the line down quick and it's pretty small with no tables just a tall bar along the side of the wall with bar stools. But just right outside of the hallway you can find some couches and seats. It's pricey for just pizza but it's at the Cosmo on the strip, so expect to spend a little no matter where you go ;) 

TIP: You won't find this place on any directories. It's on the 3rd floor down an alley."
