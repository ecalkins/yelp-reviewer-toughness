I think not. : ) after hearing so many good things about the East Coast style slices, I really needed to taste test this place for myself. as an avid fan of big, thin slices, it was cool to go search this popular joint out n c what the hype was all about!

Secret Pizza is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in the city of Las Vegas. it's on the 3rd floor of the hotel where STK is. if u c a small, dark hallway with lots of old record covers on the walls. (what r ""records?"") 

the space inside is pretty small n dark. there's an area where u pick the slices n pay. there's maybe 3 stools to sit n eat at. thank god there wasn't a line when we were there so we found empty spaces to stand n eat by the wall. we got a slice of Meatball & Ricotta n a slice of White Pizza. for me, the amount of cheese on them was perfect cuz I'm lactose-intolerant. if there was more cheese, I'd probably b throwing it all up an hour later. yep, pretty gross. 

I'd definitely go back for another slice if I was on the Strip again. it's probably the cheapest n tastiest meal I've ever had in Vegas!"
