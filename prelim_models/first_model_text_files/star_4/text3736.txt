I've seen a few people walk out with two slices. I would have probably just ordered a whole entire pizza, which is what we did during the day.

We called in advance and ordered two full size pizzas. Those run anywhere between $27-$35. You can get drinks (both alcohol and sodas) and dessert. 

Now the low down on the food. The pizza is thin crust and they're able to cook the dough just right."
