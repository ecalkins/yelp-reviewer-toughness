Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  

Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.

Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    

My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  

Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.  

No time for a sit down dinner, want a quick slice (or whole pizza), or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness.  Secret Pizza can be a strong option.  That is, if you can find it."
