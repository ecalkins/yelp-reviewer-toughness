I got the white pizza which was very tasty with ricotta and mozzarella cheese. a nice large slice to fill my belly. The other pizzas looked just as amazing. pizza was a little on the greasy goodness side. The thin, NY style crust was tasty but not spectacular. 

Friendly service and an atmosphere found in local small town/city joints. Hard to believe it's in a luxury hotel. Pretty cool.

Prices for the large slice was good, about $5. I'll be back again."
