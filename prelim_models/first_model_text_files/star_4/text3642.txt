Took us a good 360 spin around when we got to the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan, but we found it! It's literally down the hallway in between 2 restaurants and it was a lot smaller than I expected. Luckily, there was no wait when we got there and was able order right away.

My friend and I ended up getting a slice of their White, Margherita, and a Sausage w/ ricotta cheese. My personal favorite was the white pizza, but the sausage one definitely had more flavor to it. They fire it up in the oven for a minute or two so it comes out nice and crispy which is pretty awesome. When I asked for some banana peppers, they guy said they didn't carry that and ended up giving me some peperoncino instead (similar, but a little sweeter imo).

Each slice is $5.50 and with a drink our total came out to a little over $20. The slices are a pretty decent size - although they're more on the thinner side. Honestly, the price is pretty steep for a slice but if you're in Vegas...it's sort of a given. Might be back for more, but not if it's out of the way or if the line's crazy long."
