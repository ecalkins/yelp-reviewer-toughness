I'm just going to keep this real short.

Secret Pizza isn't much of a secret. You'll notice where it is as soon as you see people eating pizza while in the sitting areas. It's an awesome place for food when you're drunk or right after you get out of the club. Or any time, really. I usually go at night.

Their cheese pizza is best. Stringy, gooey cheese. 

Their pepperoni is really salty and covers the taste of their cheese. Good if you like pepperoni. Not good if you want to just taste the cheesey goodness. 

If you're with friends, get a whole pie. Split it. Much more cost efficient and you get more pizza that way.

One slice is around $5-6. One pie is about $28-30. That is assuming you're just getting a cheese pie or pepperoni. The more toppings you get, the more expensive. Price is average to be honest, especially compared to places like Grimaldis. 

If you haven't tried it, try it. Always start off with a slice of cheese pizza."
