Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.

Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).

All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.  

BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day (""Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS"")."
