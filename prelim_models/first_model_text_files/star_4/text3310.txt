It was nothing special anymore. I feel like ever since the secret has been reviled so did the amazing pizza. I can make better pizza at home. The crust was bland in comparison. They need to possibly oil their crust in my opinion. I give them a solid 4 stars because although I'm complaining I want to make it a point to say they are still good pizza but the price you are paying it should be greeeeeeat pizza lol
