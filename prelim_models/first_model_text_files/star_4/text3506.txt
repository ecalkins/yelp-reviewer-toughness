The walk there is always a little hazy so I can't really help much on any specific direction towards the place, BUT it's on the 3rd floor at the Cosmo if that helps! New york style thin crust pizzas that surpass all expectations. The wait is always excruciating because once that scent of that damn pizza hits your damn nose you just want to gobble a slice whole right then and there, BUT BE PATIENT you'll get to the front of the line eventually :)"
