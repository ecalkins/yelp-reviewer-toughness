It wasn't as difficult as I thought to find...on 3rd floor, if you see a random long hallway next to a restaurant...huzzah! You have found it! 

We got a custom made 3 toppings large pizza to go (~$30), which was super delicious, but the wait for the pizza after ordering was over 35 minutes...so take that into consideration for the entire pie. The roasted tomatoes topping was my favorite part of the pizza...and the crust! Loooooooove pizza crust. The large size was enough to feed 5 of us, plus enough leftovers as pre-clubbing dinner the next day!"
