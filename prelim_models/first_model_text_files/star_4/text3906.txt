0	A must try if you're ever visiting the strip. It's hidden inside the Cosmopolitan, so might be hard finding it, especially late at night after a couple drinks in your system. I have to say, the pizza is amazing. The white pizza is a must have when going here. The only thing is that it's quite on the pricey side (like everything at Vegas), so don't expect to be full after a slice or two. Per slice starts at $5 and goes up from there. Also get a fat tuesday or soda from the street, because soda is $4 a can here.
