I usually like to keep my pizza real simple: either margherita or pepperoni. My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5/slice but it's worth it.

It's a tiny place with a few chairs and by a few I mean about 4-5 chairs. But if you're eating pizza at 1:30am, you must be feeling good and nothing could go wrong."
