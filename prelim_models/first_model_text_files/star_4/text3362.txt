It's modesty is a welcome contrast in bold Las Vegas. $5 for an excellent large slice of pizza. I was staying nearby for 2 nights and visited this place twice for a snack. Tried the vegetarian and the mushroom. My friend ordered the white pizza both times. I was told that there's up to an hour wait in line on weekends. I can understand why. It's delicious."
