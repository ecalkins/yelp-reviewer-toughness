The only reason I say splurge is because their mojitos are to die for and I always get their El Molcajete with a cup of tortilla soup. It is certainly worth the price as it is an abundance of delicious food with the potential for left overs.

The only reason I give this place four stars is because there have been times when I have gone and my service hasn't been great. Usually they weren't during busy times and the majority of times I have been in for lunch or dinner, the service has been good."
