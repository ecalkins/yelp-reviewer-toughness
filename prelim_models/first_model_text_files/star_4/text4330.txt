If you are in a hurry, don't come here.  My visits here have not been ""slow"" but this is a sit down restaurant and the kitchen takes a little while.  Kitchens are slower when they are making food from scratch - the end result is better food.

I've always had friendly service and last time I was in they were training some nice new people.

Kids menu is very reasonable and there are tons of choices - all of them mexican food.  If your kids will only eat chicken fingers and boxed mac n cheese then I suggest a chain restaurant.  My daughter liked her taquitos, beans, and home made vanilla ice cream.

I'm glad this restaurant opened in our neighborhood.  I wouldn't drive across town just to eat here but it is worth a shorter trip or a visit if you are in the area."
