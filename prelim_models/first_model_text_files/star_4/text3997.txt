""Hidden"" in a random hallway tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, this tiny pizza shop is definitely one of the better places to grab some grub at the Cosmo. Nothing fancy, great classic rock tunes, and delicious NY style pizza.  The crust is thin and crispy and the cheese is melted just right. 

If you don't mind garlicky breath, go for the White Pizza! IT IS SO GOOD. The cheese lover in me rejoices! Add some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Open late for all you dancers @ Marquee :) 

FYI: Pizza is $5.50/slice and drinks are $4....they also serve beer and wine"
