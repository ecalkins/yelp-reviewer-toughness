It honestly wasn't that hard to find and there wasn't much of a line when we went but right after, a huge group came in. PERFECT TIMING. The pizza is fairly thin and mad greasy, get those napkins ready! I had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was a solid piece of pizza. Best I've ever had? Nah, brah. It was still pretty good and wouldn't mind venturing there again in a drunken stupor."
