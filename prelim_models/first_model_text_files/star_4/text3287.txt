Only come here if you really want pizza and are really drunk because after the club, this place is chaos and with a 20 minute line, you're going to be waiting for a while. Unless you order a slice but at $5/slice when a whole pizza is $20, who would do that? Not this cheap bastard.

It must have taken me near 40 minutes to get the whole pizza I ordered. On both days I came here. But, yea, it was worth it, because where else in Las Vegas can you get a whole pep at 3 am in the morning without walking around the strip?

Though if you're really in a hurry, Vegas follows the CREAM (cash rules everything around me) rule. But you're going to be paying $20 on top of $20 if you want to bypass the line."
