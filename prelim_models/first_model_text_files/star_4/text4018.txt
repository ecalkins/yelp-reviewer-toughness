0	$5 a slice is a bit much but it's Vegas and it's at the Cosmopolitan so it is sort of expected. Otherwise this place is awesome! I love how simple it is, yet unique at the same time due to it's obscure setting within such a lavish and artistic hotel. Our pizza was the perfect ending to our trip to Vegas after countless complex meals at the restaurants or buffets on the strip. The pinball machines were a huge bonus, a refreshing change to the slot machines downstairs that eat up your money with the push of a button.
