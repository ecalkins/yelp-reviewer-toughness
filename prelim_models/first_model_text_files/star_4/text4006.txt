This place is a good hang over or just when you're craving for some pizza. It's located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. This is not an easy to find pizza place. But to get there, take the elevator or escalator, where the big crystal chandeliers are, by the entrance facing Las Vegas Blvd. Go to the top floor, then you'll find some lounge chairs at the center and a sushi restaurant. You will see an alley with people lining up, and that's where it is. There are barely chairs and tables to sit down and eat, most likely, you'll have it to-go. Nevertheless, their pizza is good, especially after a hard core partying."
