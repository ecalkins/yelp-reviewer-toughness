Parking and Location: Located inside cosmo, on the second floor next to some restaurants.

The layout of the place is pretty small and more than likely you'll end up eating outside at the pool table. While waiting in line you can see the have some cool decor and nice music. Customer service is alright nothing too spectacular at the same time they aren't douches at all.

The wait isn't too bad too, the line moves generally fast. Pick a pizza, choose any extra toppings, pay, receive pizza.

Overall not too bad, I usually come here after a concert."
