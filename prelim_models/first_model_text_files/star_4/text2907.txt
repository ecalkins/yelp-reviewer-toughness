So this place is in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  There are no signs, nothing listed in the directory.  You just have to know where it's at.  You go down a random hallway and it opens up to what looks like a pizza joint in NYC.  no menu, no anything.

Since Cella P and her boyfriend were supposed to meet up with us, Liezl E and I just waited in line.  Well, after a few texts back and forth, they weren't coming and we were already in line to try this pizza, so hey, how about we buy a whole pizza and bring it back to the house?  Sure!

We ordered a whole pie - standard pizza - half with pepperoni and half just plain cheese.  I had some of both - the sauce, the cheese, the dough.  SO GOOD.

If you want to attract some drunks and crazies, just walk through the Cosmo and out on to the strip to Planet Hollywood (which is where are car was parked)  We got a lot of ""I'll give you a dollar for a slice"" and ""where did they get that pizza""

We all enjoyed the pizza, and I'll definitely be back to the random place inbetween two restaurants when I'm in vegas later this month."
