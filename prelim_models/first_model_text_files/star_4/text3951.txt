Famous for their white pizza, this pizza parlor gives you Vegas quality dishes at lower costs than other places. I recommend getting a group of 4 and sharing a box of their famous white (adding toppings like pepperoni or onions on top).

The pizza portions were huge and the white pizza was not shy of cheese including ricotta which is one of my faves. I wish the pizza had more sauce but I was impressed nonetheless and definitely filled. We added pepperoni on top of ours which was a perfect meat additive."
