I had the white pizza due to my addiction to garlic and I can't remember what my husband had, but I would guess two slices of the cheese.  I will admit the pizza was slightly greasy but you don't eat pizza when you are trying to be healthy.   The guys behind the counter were very friendly.  We chatted with them for a bit while we were eating.   We didn't go after clubbing so they weren't too busy, but I would call it a steady stream of people though for a tucked away location.
