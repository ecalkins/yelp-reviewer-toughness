This vegas strip joint reminds me of the real ny slice found in many places in NYC. Definetly recommend conducting your own ""scavenger hunt"" and rewarding yourself with a slice of pie. They are open late and perfect to stop at before hittin the nightlife. I deduct 1 star because slice is a bit over priced, c'mon its a slice of pizza. They would make more money if they dropped the price by a buck. I ordered a combo slice, pepperoni slice and a drink..$14."
