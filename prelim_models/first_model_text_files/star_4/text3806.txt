You see all these record covers on the wall leading into the place. So you get there and there are funny men behind the counter making pies and joking. It just puts you Ina relaxed mood and gets you ready for a slice. I am a pizza purest at hurt. Meaning I judge a pizza place by a simple cheese slice. If that is executed well it's a good sign of what's to come. So I ordered cheese and pepperoni.  Did I need two slices? NOPE... I am miss piggy so I had to get them. The cheese pizza was right up my alley. The thin crust with a decent amount of cheese and sauce ratio. You take your slice and sit on one of three few stools they have or you stand. Still you don't mind because that big slice of pizza is smiling at you. You have to smile back. Another spot that will be a Vegas staple to visit.
