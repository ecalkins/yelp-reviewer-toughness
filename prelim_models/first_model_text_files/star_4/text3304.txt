0	"""Secret Pizza"" (I believe this is an unofficial name...right?) is located down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  I felt silly asking someone, ""Excuse me, where is Secret Pizza,"" but thankfully he was in on it and directed us there.

Walk down the 30 foot hall and you're transported from the glitz of the Cosmo into what looks like a small-town pizza joint.  There are no tables (just a couple counter spots) and the decor consists mainly of 2 pin ball machines.

I just had a cheese slice. (Slices are $4.75, + 50 cents for each topping. Standard Vegas prices, but I could've easily turned those 5 bucks into $5,000 on slots).  The pizza is very good, similar to a slice you'd get in New York.  The one problem we had is that our slices were not heated up enough, and were on the cool side of lukewarm.

I don't think there's any reason for Secret Pizza to be a ""destination""...but if you're staying in the hotel or happen to be passing through, it's a good spot for a slice."
