0	A solid 4 star slice of Pizza. The restaurant is really a mild secret, there is no signage for it, and both the yelp and google maps have the pin in the wrong  location. Ask a cosmopolitan employee and they will point you in the right direction. Yes you will wait, but the wait was not too long 10-15 min tops, and for $5 was a welcome easy dinner after being drunk for the past 48 hours.
