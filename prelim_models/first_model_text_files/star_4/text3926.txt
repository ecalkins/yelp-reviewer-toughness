I opted for an entire pizza as I have a fridge in my room and could keep the leftover pizza. Typical new york style, big and floppy with an inedible crust (well maybe if I had something to dip it in). It was ok for new york style, and I'm sure the drunk people love coming here after a night of debauchery for a bit of pizza. If I were to get pizza again in Vegas I'd probably opt for something different, mainly because new york style isn't my thing. But if it is, you'll enjoy it!
