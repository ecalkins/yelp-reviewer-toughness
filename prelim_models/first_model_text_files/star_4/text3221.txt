It is however a great, cheap place to fuel up or soak up drinks. There was no line when we stopped (about 8pm) but I did enjoy the hallway plastered with old school album covers. 

We each had a giant slice of meatball pizza - truly, it is damn good pizza. The crust is perfectly crisp with just the right chew. It's as close to NY style as you're going to get here. 

You can also get a glass of the finest box wine for $6 here but it's a giant pour (see my photo) so I'm not even mad. The staff is fun and the pizza is legit, even if it's no secret anymore."
