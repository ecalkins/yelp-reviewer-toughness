I love the concept of ""Secret"" although we cut out the mystery location part pretty quickly when we asked a shop keep in The Cosmopolitan exactly where to find said Secret Pizza.

Sure enough, down a long hall covered in vinyl record covers, lies Secret Pizza! Small space with little counter ledges for eating, pinball machine, and jovial pizza makers present, I'd say that this brand of pizza is pretty cool. And delicious."
