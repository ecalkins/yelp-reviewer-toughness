Pizza is already made...but they toss it back into the oven when you order a slice.  I go with the white sauce, and add pepperoni or other mix into the equation.  I've tried the red sauce, but since white is so much better to me, I usually go with what I know lol.

No where really to sit when it is busy, and the line can get pretty crazy at times, but if you don't mind waiting a little while and standing while you eat, this is a decent slice of pizza.

Try it out :)"
