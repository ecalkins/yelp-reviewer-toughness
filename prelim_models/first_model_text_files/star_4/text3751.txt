I couldnt wait that long or in a line seemingly never ending... Fast forward to this year, I finally I got to sample the slices that everyone has had. We had slices of the famous white pizza and ones of the regular cheese. Both were good but the white pizza was different for me. It tasted great with the ricotta cheese and mozzarrella. Get that for sure. The regular slices we had with pepperoni. Big NY style slices.

Even on a non-crazy busy night here, we still had to wait for the white pizza do be done baking. Otherwise you are left to choose from what they have at the ready. Good stuff. I liked it. Service was indifferent.  

Standing room only. Take your pizza outside or stand inside if there is space along the wall. Pick your pizza. Slice or whole. Pick your toppings. Wait. Eat."
