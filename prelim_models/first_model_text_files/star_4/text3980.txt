My Yelp GPS didn't even pick up the restaurant. Finally, my great smell GPS directed me in the right direction. Secret Pizza is located down a hall way on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. I went to Secret Pizza around 11:30am and the restaurant was filled. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and white pizza. The pizza was delicious. The flavor of both slices of pizza made my taste buds smile. The pizza came out hot. The service was pretty fast. The employees were friendly. The restaurant isn't very big and seating is very limited. Secret Pizza has a nice social atmosphere. Secret Pizza is not a secret anymore. I definitely will return to enjoy the pizza at Secret Pizza next time I'm in Las Vegas. I highly recommend trying Secret Pizza if you are in Las Vegas. Thanks to my Yelp Las Vegas friends for recommending Secret Pizza.
