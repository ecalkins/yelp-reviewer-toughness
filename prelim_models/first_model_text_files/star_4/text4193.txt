           I knew when the chips and salsa came we were in for a treat. 
The chip are a little thicker and  served warm with two salsas one red and the other tomatillo and beans. Heck the refried beans were tasty.  
        I ordered  a small guacamole , it had a little cheese stick on top as a garnish and sprinkled with cojita cheese. It was impressive to look at and tasted even better .
           i got the combo plate with carnitas burrito and chile rellano stuffed with steak picado i think thats how u spell it. The chile came with a red sauce and drizziled with sour cream , it was very good. The carnitas burrito was a little dry, jus carnitas and tortilla nothing else in it. Maybe i should have gotten it enchilada style , maybe my fault. The plating again was beautiful, the rice and beans tasty and fresh. I think i saw chef leticia's in the kitchen she looked busy ,if she was not i would have complimented her food , bravo."
