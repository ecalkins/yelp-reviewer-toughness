My friends are all carnivores so we got a pepperoni pizza pie the first night, but they were all raving about the white sauce pizza the second night. 

If you go after 2pm, prepare for a long line and sometimes, creepy drunk guys. And if you are ordering an entire pizza pie, plan to wait at least 40 minutes longer. However, if you don't mind waiting and find watching drunk people entertaining, then you should definitely try this place out!"
