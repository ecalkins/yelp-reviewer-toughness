It was Monday morning at 11:00AM and the girls wanted to grab some slices before heading home.  Wandering around the hotel, I asked one of the nice Cosmo' staff where the pizza joint is.

Staff: ""Hmmm.. I don't know if I can trust you. This is some top secret pizza.""
Me: ""Really? Because it got a gang of reviews on Yelp. How top secret can it be?""
Staff: ""Hmm good point. You're standing right in front of it.""

So the pizza place opens at 11:30 and there was a wooden door/wall in between 2 restaurants, so we waited. 11:25 came and there were already people lining up. 

Once the place opened the wooden wall was flipped and we walked down the long corridor and finally saw the pinball machine people were talking about.  We were greeted by some young cheery staff members. They had 4 pies ready which included: white, meat with mushrooms, plain cheese and a pepperoni.

As we placed our order, the pizza maker told us it'd be cheaper for us to get a pie.  We decided to do a half white and half sausage/pepperoni/mushroom. It came out to about $24 for a pie.

White pizza. Good if you like ricotta cheese. Very soft texture but very flavorful. The meat/mushroom pizza was just okay to make. The dough was nice and soft with crisp golden edges but the ingredients lacked the umph.  It could be in the marinara sauce. Who knows.

Overall a good pizza for something on the Vegas strip at a swanky place like the Cosmo. I wouldn't say it's to die for (unless you're broke and needing to save all the $ you can for gas so you can make it back to LA). LOL. 

There were about 5 stools available so I suggest standing while eating. Staff was incredible - 5 star service!"
