If you go to the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and look for the hallway lined with old record albums, you've found it.  It's open late and is conveniently placed on the same floor as the exit for Marquee Nightclub to satisfy those late night munchies.  So plan on waiting in a line if you go during late night hours.

Pizza can be bought by the slice or whole.  Pepperoni is always a winner, but if you want something fancier, their Meatball & Ricotta is a tasty option.  Slices will range from about $5 and up depending on how many toppings you want.

Besides being one of the ""cheaper"" food options within the hotel, the pizza is actually good.  The crust is NY style, so it's thin but not too thin and with just the right amount of chewiness.

Once you eat here, it's no secret that you'll be back for more."
