While waiting, we tried to get a drink at the bar, but it was tough getting a menu and a space at the bar.  Once we were seated, though, the whole experience changed.  The service was awesome- prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, not over the top.  The food was great, too.  The guacamole w/ jalapenos was fresh and fantastic.  The small was plenty for 2.  My wife had the ""something"" casa chili verde.  The pork was tender, the beans were good.  I had the ""something"" Quesa- their house special.  I had one shrimp taco and one shredded chicken.  It was awesome.  I would get the shredded chicken again and try a different filling instead of the baby shrimp.  Oh, and we each had a margarita that was top shelf ingredients and quite good.  Maybe I'm still a country bumkin' adjusting to big city life, but I thought this place was great.  5 stars for food and service.  3 stars for generic ambience."
