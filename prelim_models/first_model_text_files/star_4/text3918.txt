0	Secret pizza is  great for when the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan hotel are really busy. The pizza is good, a bit greasy. The staff is fast and we got an entire pizza in about 10 minutes. It is an unmarked hallway near the restaurants in the Cosmopolitan hotel. There are small counters with bar stools if you're single or with one other person. No real tables to sit at, so we brought our entire pizza back to our room.
