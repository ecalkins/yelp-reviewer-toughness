Even though I read where it was I still had a hard time finding it. It is on the 3rd floor near several other restaurants. Literally look for a dimly lit hallway with old record albums lining the wall. If you see a pinball machine straight ahead you've found it! 

I lived near Chicago for 11 years so it's hard for me to appreciate anything other than Chicago style pizza (deep dish an/or thin crust with sweeter sauce). That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice. 

The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection. 

Will definitely remember this place for a quick, easy snack or meal."
