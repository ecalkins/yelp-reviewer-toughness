The novelty of this place is what earns it four stars. Knowing about this little place makes me feel like I'm part of an exclusive club (or at least a club that 187 other yelpers know about). 

I tried the mushroom and white pizza. Both were delicious thin crust style pizza. The mushrooms on top my pizza were particularly delicious. And at $3-$4 a slice this is probably one of the best deals in Vegas, and definitely the cheapest meal that I saw in the Cosmopolitan."
