If you weren't looking for it, you really would walk right past it. My favorite thing about this place is that it is open till 5am which means I can have a quality slice of pie after a night of drinking. There has always been a long line when I have gone to this pizzeria but it moves fast. I have tried several different pizzas but if you've heard about the white pizza, it's true. It's one of the best. I really enjoy the pizza here and it's one of my go-to's every time I am in Vegas.
