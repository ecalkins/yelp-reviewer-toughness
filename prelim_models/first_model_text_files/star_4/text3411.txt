0	By far one of the best pizza joints in town. There's only one other I find is just a bit better due to greater convenience, time of service, and price that's 15 minutes off the strip (check out my review on Mama Depalma's pizza & bistro) but if you're on the strip you won't find any better! Their pizza is thin crusted served hot and has the allure of being tucked away down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan casino. You'll know you're at the right place though when you see dozens of album covers and a long line of people waiting to pay top dollar to see what all the buzz is about. It's a unique Vegas story you can tell your friends about and the well seasoned and in my opinion just amount of oily pizza is just as good of an experience. Be willing to spend 30 minutes at least getting to it and waiting in line and around 4-5$ a slice to enjoy it :) Vegas specialities on the strip come with a price!
