I LOVE THIS PLACE. The pizza has the perfect thin crust and the toppings are amazing. Only downfall? Prices...it's pretty expensive, even when you're drunk. 

Recommendations:
Meatlovers: Sausage, Pepperoni, and more sausage?!? I mean really, you can't go wrong. They're homemade sausage has herbs and spices and just delicious. I get this every time.

White Pizza: This thing is also REALLY GOOD. The only reason I don't get it is because it doesn't have meat...heh heh. It has ricotta cheese and garlic and more cheese. It's so good...I just wish it had meat. 

Overall, you can't go wrong when you're here. It's so good AND open late. Definitely a must come when in Vegas."
