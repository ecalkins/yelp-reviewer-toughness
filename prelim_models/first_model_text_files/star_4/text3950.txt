Came at 4am reeking of nightclub, desperate for a slice - some cheese, one slice left of blanco, and one slice of pepperoni. Heaven.

Doughy crust, cheesy goodness, thin crusted on the bottom - what more do you want? Grab lots of napkins and fold in half for ultimate nomz. Yeah it's expensive per slice, but look where you are - Vegas is not known for cost effectiveness.

Two greasy thumbs up."
