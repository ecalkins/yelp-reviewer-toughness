After waiting in line for about 40 min, we ordered: 
2 litter of soda: $8
2 topping pizza (sliced sausage and pepperoni): $31 

They said our wait time was going to be 25min. It took about 15 min so we were very pleased with that. 

We took it back to our hotel room to eat it. Pizza was still hot. Getting the sliced sausage was definitely worth it. It added some zest to a basic pepperoni pizza. 

Definitely recommend getting a whole pizza over slices. More bang for your buck."
