I can't tell you the exact location as it will take the fun away from searching for it.  BUT, if you don't enjoy playing games, ask around, look for people NOMing on pizza, or find the hallway of records and it will lead you there.   

White Pizza - Cheese, ricotta, and garlic on a perfectly toasted crust; simple, delicious, cheesy"
