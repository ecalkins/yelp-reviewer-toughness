We hadn't seen anything that appealed in Planet Hollywood.  I suggested we step into the Cosmopolitan to see what we could find.  

All the restaurants here were more upscale than we were looking for.  We were just about to give up, when I noticed a hall way lined with album covers, and remembered reading about a hidden pizza joint, so I headed down the hall.  Her Majesty thought I was headed to the restroom again.  At the end of the hall you are greeted by a small, brightly lit space lined with white subway tiles. There is a menu board on the wall.  Pizza by the slice, or by the whole pie, sounds like lunch to me!

The pizza is NY style; thin and floppy with a puffy edge.  Very tasty, and reasonably priced considering it's Las Vegas."
