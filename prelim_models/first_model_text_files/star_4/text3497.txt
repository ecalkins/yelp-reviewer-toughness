After a night of partying in Vegas you crave that greasy food!! Well lucky for us we were staying at the Cosmo hotel.  We tried to find it when we first arrived and no there isn't signs to help you find this place. So we asked and everyone knows where it is.  At 2am we came here and the line was loooong!! We waited a good 30-40 minutes in line but when you're in Vegas line ups are very entertaining, so time went by fast and soon enough we got our pizza.  They sale by the slice and whole pizzas.  I opted for a pepperoni pizza.  It was yummy crust is thin but not crunchy, topping was great!! Satisfied that craving."
