0	"LOCATION: Go to the 3rd floor from the East Wing elevator and turn right.  When you see ""Zuma"" (not built yet as of 12/2016), look directly across and you'll see a long hallway with photos hanging on either side.  You may even see a guy who looks like a bouncer with a blue suit on.  Go down the hallway and you are there!

COST: $5.00/slice for cheese and $5.50/slice for those with toppings.  I highly recommend getting the white pizza if you like garlic.

They serve NY style (thin) pizza so if you're into the regular or Chicago style pizza, this is not the place for you.  I thought the pizza here was REALLY good but I wish the prices were cheaper.  Regardless, definitely worth the visit if you're craving pizza.

As a side note, I'm not sure if ""Secret Pizza"" is really their true name as they bill credit cards under the name ""Cosmo Pizzeria."""
