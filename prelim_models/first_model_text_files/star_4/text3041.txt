So when hunger pangs are aflurry at 0400, Secret Pizza is the spot to quell thems.  However, you don't actually know where to find the restaurant per say, so just follow where the pizza boxes are coming from.  Totally super secret - you don't even know it exists where it does, it's so well hidden. 

After finally finding it, you will see that the line will be out the hallway and that there is just one LONG line. Apparently, this secret isn't so secret after all.

For being in such a fancy establishment, it's pretty hole in the wall.  There isn't anything fancy to it. It actually could use some mopping and/or wiping down of the counters.

The pizza, frankly, it speaks for itself, and is the reason why you're here - let's just say the guys behind the counter didn't take a break from crackin out them pizzas. With a variety of slices to choose from, even white pizza *GASP* they didn't stop moving. Their pizza was THAT good!

They've got beer on tap and soda too. Prices affordable. They even deliver to your room if you're staying at the Cosmo. Convenient!  Be sure to check this spot out before you leave."
