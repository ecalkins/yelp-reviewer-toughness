Located on the 3rd floor where all the restaurants are concentrated, it was easy to find since there was a long line propagating in the ""hidden"" hallway. I was somewhat annoyed that I had to wait for the pizza, but the pizza was decent. You can tell that the dough is quite fresh and had an authentic Italian taste to the crust. If you can avoid waiting in line for this place, it is even better. They have a water dispensing machine by the cash register, but that device does not work properly as it barely trickles any water. You are better off purchasing a drink than relying on their water dispenser. They had some vintage pinball machines in this pizza joint, but they were non-functional. Also, my pizza was somewhat cold so if you are getting slices of pizza, make sure to ask them to reheat your pizza so that it is piping warm."
