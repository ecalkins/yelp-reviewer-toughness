I was pretty tipsy and all I remember was going through different sets of elevators and escalators, past swanky lobbies and convention rooms, and suddenly I was walking down a hallway of vinyl records filled with other drunken people.  You'll smell the place before you see it...IF you see it!

Was led to Secret Pizza by Mr. Dubs for some late-night munchies to soak up the booze that wouldn't leave my system.  I had a hankering and Pizza was calling my name.  Heeding Siren's call, this place was suggested to me after Mr. Dubs' own drunken adventures with his crew.  We ordered four slices and took it back to our room.  Eating pizza on the balcony of your Cosmopolitan suite is pretty amazingly epic when it's 4 in the morning.  Am I Chrissy Teigen?

Maybe it was the alcohol but sinking my teeth for that first bite of cheesy meaty goodness was amazing.  New York style thin crust, some cheese drag action, and a generous helping of toppings.  I'm in Heaven.  It's not the best pizza ever or even the best slice on the Strip but it's pretty darn good and nicely priced!  At $5+ a slice, it was great.  The slices are gigantic and I only ate one slice out of the two that I ordered.  Passing out in a food and booze coma afterward resulted in the best sleep ever.  Hurray for Secret Pizza!"
