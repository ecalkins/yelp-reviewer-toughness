What was good about this pizza joint is the fact that it's New York style pizza and I'm a sucker for crunch thin crust pizza by the slice. I have to be quiet honest though that this place is a tad pricey compared to the normal pizza by the slice spots that I go to in the bay.

Me and the wifey simply came here on a very very small appetite, but the fact that we were in Vegas and looking for something to do, I suggested we searched for this so called ""Hidden Pizza"" spot I can always go for a nice slice of New York style pizza. Anyways we only ordered one slice of pizza to share amongst us two, as I mentioned before that we came here not hungry at all. Well, we ordered a meatball pizza, which was something we have never had before and thought it would be interesting to try something new along with this new place. The taste of the pizza was a bit odd, probably because the whole time I was eating this pizza I was thinking that meatballs can't belong on a pizza. But all in all the pizza was good, and I can't wait to come back here for another slice when I'm in the area. I also like the fact that this place is open late, not a lot of pizza joints that sell pizza by the slice is open this late.

Better believe I'll be back for more, and just maybe this place will get another star."
