When we got to our table we didn't have silver ware or napkins till after boh our drink and food orders were put in. We didn't get our chips till then either. It was also slightly hard to communicate to the servers and others at the table because the music was very loud. A member of m group order the soup and he said it came out room temperature. He asked for it to be warned up which I'm sure just involved a microwave. I order the enchilada teqitos  which were very tasty. The child in our group gobbled up his chicken and was super satisfied with his dinner. Still love this place.
