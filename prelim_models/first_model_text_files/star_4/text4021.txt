We tried the veggie, pepperoni + pepperoccini and a white slice. All of us agreed that the crust was really tasty and crispy. There was a nice seating area with comfy seating down the hallway. Not much seating inside Secret Pizza so better to bring your slice and find another place. Would come again if craving a slice late at night."
