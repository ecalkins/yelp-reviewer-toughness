0	Really cool spot in Vegas! The entrance can be a bit hard to find if you weren't looking for it, but the long line will give it away. The pizza is worth the wait. The only issue is that they run out of the pizza choices pretty quick - so, you'll either have to wait for yours to come out or select another slice.
