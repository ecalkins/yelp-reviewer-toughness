Just like a secret menu, the concept draws out the crowd because of a certain ""it"" factor.  It's just cool.  Well, thankfully, the pizza here rises to the occasion as well.  A delicious slice of new york style pizza.  Crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce, and cheese...  Definitely a place worth seeking out.  It's also a nice, humble, homestyle pizzeria for those who want to escape the rings, dings, and lights of vegas for a moment."
