I'm known to be a eat & tell-er so here you go: find the big red shoe on the first floor. Take the James Bond elevator right beside the shoe to the third floor. Get off to the right, see the sushi restaurant outside seating area? Right before that, there's a hallway. See lots of hanging pictures? You're there. If not, it's adjacent to the pool tables to the right when you get off the escalators. 
You are welcome."
