The New York-style pizza was pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing.  Yet in a city where everything is overdone and getting something as simple as a cheap, fast, tasty lunch is hard to find then this place is great.  There is hardly any seating and just a small counter to stand at.

They had a couple freshly baked options as we walked up, including a white pizza that my wife opted for and a special with hot peppers that looked good to me."
