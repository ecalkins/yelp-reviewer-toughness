The mystery of no prices and how small it is adds to the experience. My Crust was chewy but purposely chewy. The pepperoni's did have a spicyness to them. They have 2 beers on tap which none were to my liking so i stuck with Orange soda, and Free refills are a plus. Seating is Minimal INSIDE but there are places to sit when you walk back out of the hallways. MMMMMHMMM No Complaints here.
