There will be a line, but you will still have trouble finding it. It is down a very mysterious hallway right beside the sushi joint. It is truly tiny, but so perfect after a night of debauchery! There are just a few seats and a couple of pinball machines inside. Luckily, there are couches and a pool table right outside.

You can get pizza by the slice or wait for an entire pie. They continually crank out the pizzas here. The meatball and pepperoni is one of my favorites. Their sauce is delicious and the crust is thin. This is the type of pizza that you definitely have to fold in half to eat. There will be grease, but true New York pizza is also greasy. The meatball is so flavorful and fantastic. I do find the pepperoni to be a bit too spicy for my taste, but I like that it is not the generic circular pepperoni. Last night I had the opportunity to try a white slice, which was good and garlicky but seemed a little more like cheese bread and a little less like pizza, which is always a risk with white pizza. 

There aren't tons of options, just your basic slices. It is cheap for the strip, but actually a tad pricey at $5 a slice! The pizza is good, but you would only be paying $2 in New York. It is fun to be in on the secret and if I need a late night snack on the strip I know exactly where to come."
