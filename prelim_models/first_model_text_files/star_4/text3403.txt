I've been to this place every time I've been to Vegas since that fateful day we accidentally stumbled into the eclectic hallway with records all over the wall. Seriously, I went to this place every single night the last time I was in town. The wait is always crazy...but I always leave satisfied. If you can get the pizza with sliced meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta you are lucky. Thats my favorite. You can get it with garlic too. Its probably not worth all the time I've wasted waiting in line for a slice...but its a Las Vegas staple for me and my friends. A little on the expensive side but hey, it is on the strip. I will def be back.
