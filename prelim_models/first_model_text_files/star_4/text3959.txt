Ahh secret pizza i remember when i first stumbled into this gem drunk roaming cosmo wondering where everyone was getting this pizza. So after many failed attempts and countless run in's with people asking where i can get a hold of this pizza i found it down a long narrow hall way. Now if you have ever been to NYC this is as close as your gonna get to NYC pizza at least in Las Vegas, simple; thin crust and very flavorful! Atmosphere is normally drunk ass people wondering around outside the 3rd floor of the cosmo; this place is hidden in the back down a long narrow hallway by all the high end restaurants very hard to find unless you ask someone and even than it took me awhile. Service is fairly quick get in, get your pizza and get out but when its the end of the night 4-5am its packed so be warned !! Overall if your on the strip craving pizza late night snack this is the place to go if you can find it haha and well it reminds me of NY"
