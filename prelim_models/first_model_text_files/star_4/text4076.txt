Secret Pizza serves legit New York-style pies of all varieties, and their hours are every bit as legit as their pizza (open 'til 5am). It's the perfect compliment to a long night out - you'll impress the your friends with your secret-hidden-spot knowledge, and soak up the Vegas booze while you're at it!

The beer selection could be a bit better, with only two varieties on draft (Bud Light and Blue Moon when I was there), but that's being picky, isn't it?

Not much more I can say that hasn't already been said, except: GO HERE!  :)"
