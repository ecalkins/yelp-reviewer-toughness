I was Ice skating at the Boulevard Rink and decided to grab a bite to eat, was starving! I ordered a meat lover's pizza for $5 bucks a slice, The slices are pretty huge and I love how the crust is so crusty loaded with garlic.. The pizza was awesome customer service was great, it was a quick in and out kinda pizza joint. The only thing i did not like about this place was if it gets too crowded in their people will be all up in your space! :P overall enjoyed my experience."
