Pizza here is good. It's reheated perfectly in the oven and tastes delicious. There line is usually long so it ensures that you are getting a relatively fresh slice and not old pizza that's been sitting out all day.

The sausage pizza was tasty with sausage, onion, peppers and olives. The best was probably the mushroom which had a nice delicate fresh mushroom taste over a plain slice. Slices are pretty big, but you are also paying 4.5-7 a slice."
