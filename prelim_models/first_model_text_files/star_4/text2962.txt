It's through a tiny alley entrance designed walls of music records, located in 3rd floor (above the day club) inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. You'll see the tiny hallway entrance as soon as you go up the escalator towards on the left side in between other restaurants. 

Any slice of pizza is good, affordable and medium size for a slice. The cannoli is pretty good too. It's really small space inside, only enough for few people to sit so be prepared to stand while eating. We went right when it opened so it wasn't too busy. But definitely worth the pizza and cannoli."
