The white pizza with garlic and sausage was the best out of the three times I've been there. 

Knocked it down to 4 stars because they wouldn't answer the phone for our pickup order. We had to pay them a visit, place our order for a large pizza, and wait 30 minutes. Though, watching belligerent people order pizza has its own benefits. :)

They only serve you with what they have at the moment, unless you order a whole pie.

Will come back if the line isn't too long."
