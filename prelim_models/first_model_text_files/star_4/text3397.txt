The place is very hard to find and I actually had to call them up to see where they're at.  Once there, it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  It suits much better for to go than to eat in.  I ordered plain cheese and a sausage.  Both are very good and comparable to NYC pizza.  

As for price, well, you are inside Cosmo and will pay the price for that.  If you want cheaper, you need to eat away from the strip."
