Fast service. Small cramped place but there is seating outside of the hallway for you to sit. Free refills. Simple menu, they did not let us create our own pizza so you just have to choose from what they have at that time. A bit too greasy for my taste, floppy ends of the pizza, but the crust was yummy! (which I find to be a rarity). Even though the slices are big, I suggest getting 2 slices because they are so good you WILL want more especially if you have a big appetite.
