They have deserts which I have not seen offered at other Mexican restaurants, such as Capirotada (Mexican bread pudding). The server was happy to make recommendations and frequently checked in to ask of the meal was and if I needed anything else. I ordered an horchata and loved it. It was served in a huge glass (no refill needed) and so authentic, like the kind made at our family functions. It tried the Taquiza (Mexican Street Tacos) in chicken, carne asada and al pastor. They were all really great and will be back again to have them. I also had two tamales, Green Sauce Chicken and Rajas Con Queso. Unfortunately, I did not like the tamales, kinda of dry even though I got them ""Enchilada"" style. My server had mentioned that she did not care from them and that they were dry, prior to me placing the order. I appreciate her honesty and she was right. I will come back to sample more items and for the Taquiza."
