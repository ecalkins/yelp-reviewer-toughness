Straightforward pizza place with a good selection ... by the slice or a whole pie. Had the ""meat lover's"" pizza which was good (not necessary the greatest of all time, but definitely good) and also the ""white"" pizza which was even better (say very good).  

Worth a visit when taking a break from all the Las Vegas buffets and celebrity-chef restaurants."
