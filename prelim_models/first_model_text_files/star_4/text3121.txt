There is no signage stating what it is and when you look down the hallway, all you can see is a game machine.  When you walk down the hallway, there are all of these cool, vintage record covers.  They serve huge slices of pizza for about $5 a slice and drinks in red solo cups.  It's cheaper to get a whole pizza, and the 1 slice doesn't necessarily fill you up, so you might as well get a whole pie.  This is definitely worth a stop.
