The line was pretty small and they had a nice variety when I went to the counter to order.  My friends got jealous when I got to order the salami and cheese fresh out of the oven.  The prices were pretty reasonable for the location it was at (Cosmo).  I think it is some of the best pizza I have eaten in years.  

The crust has just the right chew and crisp.  A single slice would be sufficient due to the size but since we had a busy schedule planned we had to eat when we got the chance.  The cheese itself is bursting with each bite and never once bland.  It has the right amount of igredients to help curb that hunger on the strip.  The salami just oooooh damn I'm just drooling as I'm typing this up.  Screw the over priced buffets and bland drinks at the clubs - just give me another slice already!!!!!"
