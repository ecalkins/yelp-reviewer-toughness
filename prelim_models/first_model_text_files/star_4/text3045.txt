At $5.50 for a decent at best, cheese pizza slice and 50 cents extra per additional topping, my cheap self would not purchase this if it were located anywhere else. But alas it's Vegas and when you're craving pizza at 3 in the morning you kind of just dgaf. That being said I come here over and over again. 4 STARS!!"
