What I love about the place is that you're literally walking inside the fancy hotel minding your own business and then you encounter this strange hallway with records on their walls...then you keep walking a little further in....and then BOOM! Out of nowhere, You're in a pizza place back in NYC. We found this place thanks to Yelp. The prices are a little steep, but I have to say that it was a great pizza. The seating is limited so it's mostly eating in a counter kinda thing. I don't know if there's a better NYC style pizza place around Vegas but you can't go wrong with this spot. Try it....if you can find it"
