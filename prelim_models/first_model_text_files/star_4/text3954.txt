There's always people in line and that's understandable because the kitchen is so small and there are only 4 workers. When I went everyone was working really hard except for the two managers just shooting the breeze with one another. Basically they were taking up room and air.

I would say call in the order but we tried calling in our order and the phone kept ringing and ringing. Going in person though is much better. While you're waiting in line u can strike up random conversations with people all standing in line for the same thing...PIZZA!!!!! Or check out the million of pictures they have along the walls as u wait:)"
