Im a huge fan of ricotta cheese and to have it on my pizza was amazing. I also got a slice of the combo pizza and it was like a typical slice of pizza lol. I recommend getting the white pizza :-) cos you can't get it anywhere else! As for the line there's somewhat of a wait but it goes by pretty quick~
