My boyfriend decided that I should try this place since we were staying at the cosmo. I've always heard really good things about this but have never actually been because I always end up at Earls after getting out of the clubs.  Found our way around in this hidden gem through a short alley. It wasn't a long line thank goodness. With literally 4 chairs in this hole in the wall your best bet is to scoot next to someone elbow it down and eat your pizza among those others. I ordered the combo/supreme and my boyfriend had the pepperoni. Omgggg it was delicious the entire crust of the pizza was crispy and the cheese and topping just married together. Add some pepper flakes and garlic powder and you are set my friend. I'm so happy I finally got to try it! Next time we are ordering the whole pie. More cost efficient :) plus more pizza nom nom!!
