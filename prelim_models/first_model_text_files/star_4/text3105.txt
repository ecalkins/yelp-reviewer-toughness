If we didn't see people walking in the hallway, we would have totally missed it. All I remember the next morning was the pizza burned the roof of my mouth but it was good. Heck, the pizza box was empty on the floor of my suite so that was a good thing right? 

The next time I was back in Vegas, I was craving pizza and wanted to go back. Unfortunately I didn't know the name or even remembered where the restaurant was located. All I knew was it was in the Cosmopolitan. Sad how I could find this gem drunk but had a hard time locating it sober. Go figure the name of the place is Secret Pizza and there isn't a sign for the place. Now I know it's on the 3rd floor straight off the escalator. 

They have New York style pizza here and you can either by them by the slice or as a whole pie. If you don't see the slice you want on display, just ask because they have more pizzas below the display area. The slices are reheated so it's nice and hot. I really like the crust here. They also sell beer here and it does compliment the pizza well. Just keep in mind they don't have much counter seating and this place is busy. Hmmm I'm craving pizza now..."
