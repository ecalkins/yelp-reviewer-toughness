Great slice of NYC style pizza!

-Doesn't limp when folded.
-Nice chew of the soft thin crust that still had a crispness while taking a bite. 
-Balanced tang from the tomato sauce. 
-Size is on point. 
-Each slice $4-5 bucks. 


11pm. NO LINE! Splurged on a slice of the white pie (mozzarella, ricotta, and herbs), a sausage slice, and a coke. Free refills on sodas. Match made in heaven. Open til 4am! Exactly what I needed after blowing my last hundred dollars at Wheel of Fortune! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=EkcZRfT5IsVPkL4P9HxAWw#EkcZRfT5IsVPkL4P9HxAWw)


-Notes- 
They call it Secret Pizza because it's intended to be hidden with no signage. 

What you want to do is go up the elevator from the Chandelier bar, past the hordes of short skirts and high heels of Marquee, and look for the album covered hallway directly across from STK.
