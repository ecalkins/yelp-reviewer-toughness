One bite...and I did a complete 180. The pizza was yummy. In fact, the pepperoni had a nice little kick to it and the sausage was pretty good as well. 

Why 4 stars instead of 5? The slice was $4. The drink, about 10 oz, was $4.50!!! Ibit rich if you ask me. 

All in all, it was worth the trip to the strip to enjoy"
