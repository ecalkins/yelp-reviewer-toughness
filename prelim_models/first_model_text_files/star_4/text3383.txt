But it is just NY style pizza so don't go in with high expectations just because it is ""secret"" pizza.  Ordered the pepperoni pizza which I found to be really oily.  But nothing you can't blot off with a paper towel!  I like that the pepperoni are large and covet the slice.  Really close to marquee so get some pizza after going to the club!"
