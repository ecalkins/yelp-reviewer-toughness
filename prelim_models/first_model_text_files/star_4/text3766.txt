I came here with my friends as we explored the strip and this was our first stop. We got pepperoni pizza and I got the white pizza. I'm not quite too sure everything that was on the white pizza, but I'm guessing feta was a topping, which was amazing. Big fan of white pizza! 

Both were good--I'm a little biased though since I'm a fan of most people. The dough was chewy but had that nice crunch to it and the crust wasn't hard like a cracker. It wasn't drenched in sauce, which I prefer because it allows me to taste the cheese and the toppings more. Overall I was pretty satisfied. 

The line we were in was long and it doesn't really becoming a secret place when it's 20 people deep and it's leading out to the lounge, but it moved quick for us. Not much seating inside but we snagged some counter space and munched down. Very happy I got to visit this and check it off my LV bucket list!"
