We got there in between crowds which was great because I hate lines.  

The white pizza is good and the pep is good as well. The slices are $5 and served ready to go on a paper plate and a checkered greasy wrapper thats going to slide off the plate as soon as you pick up your slice.  

Secret pizza is ideal for stopping in, getting a slice and leaving, but it is also a comfortable place because its decorated with a lot of cool stuff.

Too bad this place is in Vegas because my hometown L.A. has few and far i between spots a brotha can get a good pizza slice."
