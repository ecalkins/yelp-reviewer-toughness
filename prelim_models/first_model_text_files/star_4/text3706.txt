My boyfriends friend is in a band called Secret Pizza so we wanted to check this place out. Each slice is about $5+ so we came here for a quick and yummy lunch. This is a NY style pizzeria which is hard to find. It was yummy and we appreciated all of the cool decor. Vegas food can be pricey so give this place a try if you are looking for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the strip!
