Be sure to ask someone where it is located since their are no signs pointing you to the pizza place and once you are there, no logo, but you see a bunch of people eating pizza outside which points you in the right direction. 
The place is very small and and has only 4 chairs. They have some pies ready made, once you choose your slice they will reheat them and hand them over to you. 
Slices range from about $5-7 depending on the toppings. Whole pies are over $25 
Drinks are refillable
Parmasian, oregano, red pepper offered at stations. 
Will be back!"
