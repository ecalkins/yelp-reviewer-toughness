They sell the pizza by the slice or you can buy a whole, there is a couple of beers on tap as well. Slices are decently sized and thin and very good. I was going to get a regular pepperoni pizza, however I was quite intrigued when I saw the ricotta cheese pizza. I wasn't sure if I would like the taste, so one of the employees was kind enough to let me try some of the ricotta to make sure that I would enjoy my slice of pizza. After trying the cheese and discovering how delicious it was I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a slice of the ricotta pizza, pizza and beer is always a good combo and the pizza did not disappoint. There is a counter, some seats, a couple arcades and televisions to keep up on the sports. 

Overall this a good place to stop by for a quick eat, and something very affordable without emptying your wallet like so many places in Vegas will leave you."
