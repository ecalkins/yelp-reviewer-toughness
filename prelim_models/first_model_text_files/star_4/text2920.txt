THIN CRUST OVER ANY OTHER TYPE OF PIZZA!
Every slice is a bit of heaven! If I couldn't get fat, I would have a pizza only diet (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ll075po7cH1qbyk3yo1_500.png). ^_^ I have to stop by whenever I'm in viva las Vegas! 

I dont even want to mention it, in case they ever run out for all the yelpers eating my pizza.. but you have to get extra sundried tomatoes on any slice of pizza you have. THEY ARE SO FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUS!!!!! They really make the pizza. You're welcome.

Open 24/7. Moderately priced! $5 bucks a slice. Located in Cosmo. ""Secret"" location not listed in directory, but you can find it in other yelp review/tips! Yum yum save me a slice :)"
