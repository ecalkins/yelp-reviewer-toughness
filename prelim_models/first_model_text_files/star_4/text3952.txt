Everyone said it was hidden (read below), and boy was it ever. It's impossible to find without asking someone and is located down a very little hallway between all these fancy restaurants on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan. 

Finding it alone was a little adventure, but even more rewarding because the pizza was tasty. I tried a slice of the plain cheese and a slice of the white (so much garlic). Would go again!"
