This time, I got the white pizza slice ($5.50). It was delicious. The sauce had a garlicky yet light flavor and the clumps of cheese was spread throughout the slice so evenly. I appreciate the fact that every pizza is so fresh but they also run out so quick that they have to keep making them.
The line was ridiculously long around 3am on a Friday, so expect your wait time to be close to an hour. The white slice was amazing and really hit the spot on a late Friday night."
