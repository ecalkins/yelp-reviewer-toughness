This place won't have a sign, but read the Yelp tips to find where it is on the 3rd floor or just ask building employees where it is. We went around 2am on a Friday night and though the line was really long, it moved pretty quickly. 

The slice prices range between 5 - 8. The slices are generous and I was beyond stuffed with two slices (meat lovers thin crust and the thick crust white slice). FYI, this isn't a sit down place. After you get your pizza, you can sit on the couches outside and eat there."
