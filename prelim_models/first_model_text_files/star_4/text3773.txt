Thin crust pizza, large slices, love this cheap and easy food in Vegas! 
Find the pool tables on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, find this hidden gem down a hallway of records. 

I love a simple pepperoni pizza, but why is this white pizza so addicting?! 
Don't let me hype it up... gotta try it for yourself!  Come here for just an appetizer before a fun night ahead!  Can't wait to come back and purchase a whole pie!"
