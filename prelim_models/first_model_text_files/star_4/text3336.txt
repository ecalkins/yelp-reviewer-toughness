If you want to come here to eat and not just to quell your drunchies, then come out lunch. The post-clubbing crowd always makes the line go out the door. Avoid that crowd and come during lunch. I like the white slice the best. Add some sausage and sundried tomatoes, and perfection! They have a new one called the sicilian slice which is similar to the white slice but a deep dish version loaded with what looks like 5lbs of cheese. Kind of pricey for a slice of pizza ($5.50 for white slice, $5 for red, $8 for sicilian), but they make up for it by giving you a good sizable slice.

TLDR: Clubbing at Marquee and got the drunchies? Go here! The line can get ridiculous, but come during lunch if you want to avoid it or suck it up and wait in that line to sober up and get your pizza. On the pricier side, but large slices!"
