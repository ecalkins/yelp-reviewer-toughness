Maybe it's 3:00am and you're leaving a club, and need to eat. Or, in my case, maybe it's 10:00pm and you're starving for dinner, and you just really want pizza. Whatever the case may be, take my advice. Head to the Cosmopolitan. Go to the third floor. Find all the restaurants, and the pool table. Find Secret Pizza down the secret hallway lined with music records. Eat. Be happy!
I have to admit, I didn't find this place on my own, or even through Yelp. I was sitting next to a really nice guy on the plane ride in, who told me I just HAD to try the pizza here. Best pizza in Vegas, he said. Is it? I can't judge that, because it's the ONLY pizza I've had in Vegas. However, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I went with the white pizza. Absolutely the most mouthwatering slice I've ever had. Gobs of ricotta, perfectly crisp/chewy crust. Sprinkled with the (I think) garlic powder they have on the counter, and a little parmesan. I was in carb heaven and it was WORTH IT. Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Which will be next month. I'm already counting down the days till my next Secret Pizza visit."
