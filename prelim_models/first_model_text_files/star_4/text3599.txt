It's not much of a secret, seeing as though I've heard about it a long time ago, but I guess the ""secret"" comes from no signage and it being down a long hallway on the 3rd flor of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. The pizza was very good. I had a slice of white pizza and a slice of sausage and peppercini. Now, the pizza was very good, but this is in a city full of horrible pizza. Also, the pizza is pricey, about $6 a slice, and $30.00 for a 16inch pie... Worth checking out if you're a Vegas local or a tourist in the area. There is no seating in the shop but plenty of seating in front of the art gallery/showcase common area a few feet away from Secret Pizza's entrance."
