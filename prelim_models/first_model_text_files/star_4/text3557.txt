After a long night of clubbing at marquee,  my friends and I  decided to stop by here for some late night eats. Its located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan and when you seem a long alley and you see a bunch of people In line..you know you are in the right spot. On the third floor there are pool tables and lounging chairs too so you can lounge around and enjoy your pizza. 

My friend and i shared the white pizza, which was AMAZING and delicious. We also shared a sausage pizza with green peppers and pepper jack cheese. That was amazing as well. I devoured the pizza and probably burnt the roof of my mouth since I ate it so fast while it was hot, but it was well worth it. 

The pizza is very much worth the hype and you should check it out if you're in Vegas!"
