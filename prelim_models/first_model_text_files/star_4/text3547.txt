You pick your slice off a cold pizza that has been cooked. Then they put it back in the oven to reheat it. Ok I want fresh pizza!!!! I am not sure how long it was sitting there. It had some meat options but the same meat on 2 out of handful of options. One was plain cheese so maybe more of a variety wouldn't hurt. No place to really sit unless your by yourself or at most 2 people. I think I saw 5 sitting stools. The good, it was greasy. That's good for me because if I am going to eat pizza I want some flavor and these have flavor. I would go back but if I was buying a whole pizza. Also this is very hard to find, just make sure to ask someone working in the hotel and look at the pictures some people posted as a guide. One I saw the wall of pictures I knew I was there.
