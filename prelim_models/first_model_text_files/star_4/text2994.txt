We just sucked it up and eat the damn thing , didn't bother to ask for a new pie with the correct toppings.  To much of a hassle and we were starving. 

Bargain other places, maybe not, but on the Las Vegas Strip, Bargain ! : 16"" pie with 3-toppings @ $26, and Pabst Blue Ribbon on Tap.

It's crowded, small, and it's a secret ! 

Staff is very hard working and polite, considering the noise level and the drunks they are dealing with."
