Walking down the hallway, you suddenly smell pizza. Hungry barefooted girls in line and drunk guys talking to themselves. That pizza looks godsend when you're intoxicated. I wasn't even drunk and it looked good.

I opted for the sausage/pepperoni slice. It was like $4! It was salty as ocean water man! I was gulping soda afterwards, good thing there were unlimited refills. It wasn't bad but this doesn't touch real NYC pizza at all. Nothing comes close. It's filling though."
