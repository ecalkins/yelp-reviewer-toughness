im not a huge fan of pizza myself but i heard that this place was worth a try. 

i asked the girl in front of me in line what she recommended. and she said the white slice was rly good. it's basically a slice of white cheeses. i'm not rly sure what kind. but it was $5. and i went ahead and added mushrooms for an extra $0.50

they didn't have it out at the time so they said it would take 15 minutes to make. i waited it out and it was hot and fresh and melted cheesey when i got it.

i had to pat it with a napkin since it was a bit greasy/oily for my liking. but with the pepper flakes that i added, it was rly good! and their pepper flakes actually add a rly nice spicy kick..

i bet this pizza would taste amazing as drunk food but i heard the line gets crazy long during after-club hours"
