If you come at peak hours, expect to wait 30 minutes in a line that runs down the hallway. Ordering a whole pizza will take an additional 20. I always opt for the single slice and almost always get the white pizza. Out of all the options that are offered, the white pizza is probably the most ugliest and unsavory looking pizza, but it's the most delicious. No meat, no veggies but an amazing combination of cheese. They also don't have free water, only bottled water. Overall, I love coming here and recommend it for anyone who is nearby the Cosmo hotel!
