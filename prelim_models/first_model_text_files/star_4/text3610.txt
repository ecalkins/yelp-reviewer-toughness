I got a white pizza with added dried tomatoes and I LOVED it. It's NY style thin crust pizza and the tomatoes added the perfect kick of tanginess to the slice! After finishing my slice I even grabbed the leftovers off my friend's plate to finish hers....heh. 

I really wanted to try their Sicilian pizza but unfortunately it wasn't available that day. 

Definitely wish it was more secret so the wait wouldn't be so long but until then...ill see u in my dreams :-) until next time"
