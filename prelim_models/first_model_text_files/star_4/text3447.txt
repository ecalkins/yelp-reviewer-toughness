Our first night at Vegas we came here for dinner.  My sister Joyce recommended this place because they had the best pizza in town.  This place would of been hard to find without detailed instructions since there was no sign and the location was hidden deep away through a long tunnel. 

The location was tight, a little dirty, the service was friendly and fast.  The pizza was good, I especially enjoyed the crust of the pizza, by far the best crust on a pizza I ever had.  Overall a great experience and will definitely be back."
