We were told it would take 30 mins...15 mins each pizza. And that the first would be ready in 15.  We were in a bit of a time crunch and starving, but we were down for waiting.  After going up to check on the status of the first pizza, they said that it would be another 15 mins... So instead of telling us that one pizza would be done in 15 minutes, they should have said that both would be done at the same time.....ah..what are you gonna do.

So come when it isn't mid-day on the weekends and you'll probably see a shorter line. But it seems like it's always poppin.  I'd say it's worth it."
