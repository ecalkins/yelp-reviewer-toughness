Instead we were lead into this dimmed hallway covered with vintage album records and then arrived at an aluminium decor-ed pizzeria kitchen with some stools and couple of pinball machines.

While I was hoping I'd see them freshly prepare the pizza in front of me, I suppose re-heating it suffices too.  The selection is pretty basic, you got your plain cheese, pepperoni, or sausage.  To that, you can add simple ingredients like mushroom, onions, bell pepper, etc.  Toppings will cost you extra.

The overall taste was purely simple and glistening, the way on-the-go pizza should be!  The most important fact to know about the pizza is how the crust is perfectly thin and crispy.  I almost prefer it this way!  If you are coming out of the club or lounge, $5 a slice won't matter much, you just want something good and quick to help you sober!"
