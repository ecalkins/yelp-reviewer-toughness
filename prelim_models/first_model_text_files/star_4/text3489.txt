At Secret Pizza, you'll find sizable slices of New York style pizza with a variety of delicious at $4-6 a slice. If you're rolling through with a group of people or expect to chow down, way better to get a whole pie in terms of $/slice. Like that late night pizza shop you know of in LA or New York or wherever, Secret Pizza will be just like that, serving up pie after pie until 4-5am - a perfect way to end a night after a night out. Secret Pizza certainly isn't trying to be a gourmet spot or be more pretentious than it is. Just decent late night pizza at a good Vegas price."
