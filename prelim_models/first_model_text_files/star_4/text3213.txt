If we didnt know it was already there, by word of mouth, I never would have gone, and never known it was there in the 1st place. a guy at school told me about this place (CSN) and said dang if you want good pizza ck it out.

A friend came in from out-of-state and we were strolling along the strip.. stopped by to grab a slice. soo good. I had a reg. cheese w/ ricotta damn it was good. the bf had the same and a meat lovers.. didnt look too great 2 me but to each their own. 

Ck it out .. its a must try at least once. !"
