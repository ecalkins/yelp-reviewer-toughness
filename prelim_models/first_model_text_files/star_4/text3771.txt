It doesn't have a sign to tell you it's there and it's located through a small little hallway, so it may be a little bit tricky to find. 

This place has New York style pizza. You can order by the slice, and if you want extra toppings on it, just ask and they'll put it on before reheating it in their oven. Very simple pizza but tasty. It's a very small place, and basically standing room only. This place is more of a grab and eat on the go because you can't really dine in. Worth checking out if you're close by, and who doesn't love pizza when they are drunk?"
