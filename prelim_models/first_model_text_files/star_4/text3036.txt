I've had their pizza a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. Today was no exception. I went with something simple: Their white pie (garlic sauce and healthy chunks of ricotta cheese) with sundried tomatoes. Deeee-licious! Their crust is fantastic (LOVE thin crust). Now, it's not my absolute favorite white sauce, but it's still damn good. And if you're not a white sauce fan, their red sauce is fabulous too. Also, if you're not on the go or in a hurry, get the whole pie and take it home! Worth the savings (a slice of white pie is $5 compared to a whole white pie for $30). Oh, but pass on the fountain drink though; it's a red Solo cup for four bucks. Yikes."
