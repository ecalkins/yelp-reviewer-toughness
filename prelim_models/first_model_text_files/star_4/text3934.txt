Place is clean, fast and huge portions! 
About $5 a slice. 

I've been here twice and the second experience was definitely better. 
The first time we got the all white with ricotta and I felt it was too much, it was good but It didn't have a wow factor. It was seriously soaked in grease, I used a TON of napkins to soak it up. My siblings and I felt a little sick. 

2nd time, I brought my friend since she insisted she wanted pizza and this time I got the plain one with cheese . got it crispier and that one hit the spot! I've been looking for that NYC thin slice pizza and it was close enough."
