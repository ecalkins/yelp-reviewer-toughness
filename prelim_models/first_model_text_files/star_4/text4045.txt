We came here after dinner at Comme Ca. We weren't incredibly hungry after a gluttonous meal and a whole bottle of wine, but I was intent on trying the pizza again after so long. I never go to Cosmo very often, so figured I'd take advantage. We ordered a slice of white pizza to share and some beer. Feeling tipsy, this pizza really hit the spot. We both enjoyed the flavors, although it was a little dry for my taste. I usually really enjoy pizza crust but I skipped eating this one because it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.

I'd say they are a 3 1/2 star rounded up to 4 just for being great after partying tipsy food."
