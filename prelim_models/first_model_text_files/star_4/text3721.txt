Personally I don't like waiting for much of anything in Vegas (there is so many options, just keep walking and you'll find something else).  The usually have a lot of good options and note there are additional options hiding just below what is on display.  So if you don't see what you want, it's worth asking what else they have.  The charge by the slice and number of toppings, so it's not usual to see pizzas with lots of random toppings (hence higher price) on display while plan pepperoni is hiding underneath.

Ordered:
2 Slices of Pepperoni Pizza

Overall: Best slice of pizza in Vegas.  Finding the place is part of the fun.  In my picture, the entrance to the pizzeria is right in the background (third floor of Cosmo, walk straight ahead after getting off escalators from second floor)"
