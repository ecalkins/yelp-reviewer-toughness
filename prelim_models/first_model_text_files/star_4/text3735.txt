I'd heard of Secret Pizza from both a friend and by reading around online, and my friends and I had to try it post-partying at one of the clubs nearby. It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan - I think the elevator dumps you just outside the corridor that leads you straight to heaven/the restaurant (just follow the delicious smell all the way down!). It's cafeteria style - you walk down the line and ogle every different kind of pizza they have, and then pick which slice you want. My favorite one was the supreme (I think...I'm sorry! It was 3AM! The facts are fuzzy). I think it ran about $6 a slice, which might differ depending on what pizza you get. 

There's a few seats right there in the tiny room, but most people congregated over to the couches and chairs just outside the corridor entrance. The guys working there were super nice and funny; I'm sure they deal with the drunk crowd all the time, so they sure know how to deal with them. Definitely a great little Vegas gem - open late, inexpensive, and PIZZA. What more could you ask for?"
