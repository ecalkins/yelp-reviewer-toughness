Late night study session, putting the finishing touches on a major presentation, hard night of clubbing, end of a 24 hour session of hard core grinding on the green felt.  You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you're smiling and loving life.

That said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).  

Is it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  

Inexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, ""it's a secret"".

Sometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.
