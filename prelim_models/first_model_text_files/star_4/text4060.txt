It was such a tease because I could see the pizzas and smell the aroma of freshly baked pizza, but the line was moving at a snail's pace! If I didn't see a line of people extending out of the place I wouldn't have been able to find it. It's just a hallway riddled with albums and artwork on the 3rd floor right outside of Marquee.

I ordered the sausage, pepperoni, and bell pepper pizza. The sausages were amazing; they weren't the typical types that you encounter at many pizza joints. I liked the sauce and the crust. The combination of sausages and pepperoni was too salty. One or the other would've been perfect."
