How didn't they think about a spot like that somewhere else is something I don't understand. But the cosmo did a great job with the concept and the location.

If you ask employees..they wont tell you and deny its existant. I like that..kinda keeps the mood of its ""secretness"" and makes it more exciting. Then when you gt there it's a pizza , soda and beer place ..that is it. But man..it really doesn't need anything else!!

The price can get a little high, but the large pie is pretty big. The wait tog et your pizza cooked can be a little annoying specially if its packed like it usually is. This is the biggest down side for me, because I hate waiting , I hate big lines..but I do understand that sometimes for good food there should be some sacrifices made.

Seats are very limited...actually space is very limited so plan on either standing up or taking your pizza to go.Does it worth it?? For pizza fans def does..for me...well Ill wait if the line is little if not...ill just come another time.

This is a thin crust pizza , with plenty of flavor and character.Def recommending it to you guys . should I tell you exactly where it is?? Nah...Ill let you suffer"
