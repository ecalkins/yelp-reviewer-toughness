I was immediately impressed with the fresh ingredients added to my  slice opting for onions, 'rooms and 'roni.  The crust was as close to the east coast as is possible out here in the desert.  It reminded me a bit of Pepe's in New Haven even though they use a modern gas fired pizza oven to cook their pies.

The service was great for a pizza joint.  Any cashier that volunteers free refills on the soft drinks is getting my business.  The only thing holding this place back is the lack of tables and stools.  We made due with the limited counter space.

This gem, just seconds off the strip on the third floor of the Cosmo, is a sure thing and a great, casual alternative to Pink's Hot Dogs across the street."
