Me: Hey, where are we going?
Friend: Secret pizza place.
Me: Oh? What's it called?
Friend: It's Secret Pizza place.
Me: Yeah, you said, that, but what's it called? ......
And the endless conversation continues.

Me, being in a Vegas state of mind, didn't really realize what they were all talking about until I saw a whole bunch of pizzas in front of me.  Smelling in the delicious aromas, I quickly came to and got to difficult task of choosing my slice.

But was it ever really a choice.  White pizza with meatballs please.  Yes, that was definitely the right decision.  I enjoyed every bite.  The crust is perfectly savory, and the cheese and toppings combine for a perfect treat for your tastebuds.  I almost wish I got two slices, but the line was too long to get back in, so I settled for just one.

As for the location of this ""secret pizza"" place, I could go all Gossip Girl on you and say ""Well, that's a secret I'll never tell"", but honestly, even I really have no idea where it is.  Maybe next time I'll map this place out for all you yelpers out there.  Or just read the other reviews as it seems some other people on here were actually coherent when they came here.

Just find it.  It's worth it!"
