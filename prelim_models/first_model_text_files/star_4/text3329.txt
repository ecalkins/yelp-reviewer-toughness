My friends and I decided to stop by here to try out the secret pizza spot. The place itself is fairly small so there's very little seating. If you come at a busy time there will be a very long wait for you. Luckily we got there before the rush. It's not to disappoint! I got the white slice with pepperoni. The white slice is one of their famous pizzas where they don't use any tomato sauce and it tastes kind of garlicky (: I enjoyed it a lot. The only thing is that it get pretty oily and the crust is pretty dry. The pizza was pretty cheap too considering how expensive other pizza places around here are. For mine it was only $5.50. I'd consider that cheap!"
