But it's a pizza counter with drunks side-stepping just to keep their balance who are in line ordering. You'd probably have an attitude too. 

Come, get your slice, devour it with your friends and be on your way. You will enjoy it. The pizza ranges from decent (if sober) to ""Holy crap, this is the best slice EVER!"" (if you just left Marquee and it's 4am). To really appreciate it, go after the club."
