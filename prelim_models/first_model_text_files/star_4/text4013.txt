I looked it up on Yelp because as many will tell you it is in an unmarked area of the Cosmopolitan, absent from any maps, and not obvious even when you find the right floor. Once we located it (on the third floor), the line was quite long (about 30+ deep) and it look probably a good half hour to get to the front. Once there, they had several types by the slice (you can also order a whole pizza to go), and you just point to what you, they throw in the over to make sure its hot and then pay and be on your way. The crust was crispy and chewly, topings were plentiful and price wasn't bad for a Vegas. Great for after a night at the clubs too!
