This is one of my favorite post-clubbing places to eat on the Strip and the best pizza, hands down. The NY style manages to pull off the combo of a crispy crust and loads of wonderfully cheesy toppings with quality ingredients. I like the White Pizza because I love cheese, and with the piles of ricotta, it doesn't disappoint. 

As delicious and hangover-preventing as it may be, the lines can be frustrating, especially if there is a wait and you're hungry. They do have video games, or you can take a nap on the chairs outside (and people do), but the best time to go is not midnight-3AM when the club-goers are released, if you can help it. 

Slices are around $5 each, pricey but worth it in my opinion."
