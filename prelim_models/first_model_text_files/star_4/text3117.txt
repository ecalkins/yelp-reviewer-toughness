Line doesn't move that fast and we got up there, only a few options available. We went with 2 green peppers, onions and sausage and a meat lovers. My friend and I ate the green pepper one and it was good. Loved the thin crust style. We were full so I took the other slice and gave it to my brother.

A few things I didn't like.....there are no signs of what pizza is what. Basically, you just point and guess. It was a tad pricey as it was $15 for our 3 slices. Last, the pizza was a bit greasy.

I would still come back though! Good quick bite if you need something to hold down the liquor."
