I told her that I had read about this 'hidden' pizza place upstairs.  She took the bait and said that a slice to share might be the perfect appetizer before the buffet.  Like I said, we were starving.  We headed up the escalator to the 3rd floor and found the hallway and headed on in.  One slice for $3.75 was the most perfectly cheap and delicious appetizer to tide us over.  I mean, wow!  The slice was big and the crust was very crisp.  It tasted great!  We don't make it down to the strip very often so I was glad we hit this up even for a quick slice.
