It's near many of the other restaurant but there's NO signage ANYWHERE for this place.  Hence  the secret I guess.  

We went to check it out when we first arrived to possibly get a quick lunch but it doesn't have places to sit and eat so we decided to try it later.  Bad move! 

While there during the day, there was  no line, but things changed at 3 in the morning.  There was a serious line.  But what are you to do when it's the only place open and you need some grease? 
Line moved fairly quickly and we got the slices we were eyeing earlier.  We tried the white pizza and pepperoni with peppers.  
Pizza was bomb!  Loved that it's all thin crust.  Had some good flavors going on.  The white pizza with ricotta/garlic was my favorite!   
Highly recommend if you're in the area."
