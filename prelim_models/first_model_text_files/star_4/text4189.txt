That sense of comfort translates over to the food,  where your party will be greeted not with the typical dry chip and bland salsa affair, but a hearty trio of red and green sauces, along with a surprisingly filling bean dip. My first time here I gorged myself so heavily on the preamble that I had to take my main course to go without tasting it!

The food comes out in the traditional large portions you'd expect and this leads to an occasional problem of saltiness or slightly dry meat,  but i have never once left anything other than satisfied. 

P.s the spicy crab guacamole is a spicy food lovers dream."
