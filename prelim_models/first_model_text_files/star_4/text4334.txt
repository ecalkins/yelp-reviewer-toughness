We were here for lunch but it was late so we missed the lunch specials. There were four of us and we had a custom built breakfast burrito, two taco salads (one without the shell) and one seafood soup. The food was hot, prompt, huge and yummy. We were all super happy. Our waiter was fabulous and kept our drinks filled. The free chips, salsa and bean dip were great. We would definitely come back!
