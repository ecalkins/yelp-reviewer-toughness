It's a relative bargain compared to ordering by the slice, which can be up to $5 depending on how many toppings you want. 

Everything was just as good as before, except for the soggy middle. Since a whole pizza was made fresh to order, all the cheese and grease gravitated towards the center. Plus all the cheese and toppings just slid right off the mushy crust. It probably could've used a few more minutes in the oven to develop a better crust in the middle. But it was still damn GOOD, and burned the top roof of my mouth way too many times.

If you order per slice, they'll throw it back in the oven to reheat, so you won't have the soggy-crust-in-the-middle problem. So it all depends on your preference. Personally, I like thin and crispy crust versus the soggy version. I've been here well over 6+ times, and it seems like the prices just keep creeping up. ""Secret Pizza"" isn't really so secret anymore."
