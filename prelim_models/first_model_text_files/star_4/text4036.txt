We selected a cheese slice topped with ricotta and sliced sausage and a cheese slice with meatballs and onions. I thought it was a little pricey for two slices with two toppings each.  I guess I'm just not used to paying $4.50-$5.00 a slice. The pizza was really really good. The crispy crust was slightly charred, adding a touch of bitterness to the sweetness of the crust and savoriness of the topping. Loved. Every. Bite. The toppings were really good. Especially the sausage. House-made?

Water cooler near the register for those feeling a bit dehydrated from too much sun or whatever. Nice touch. :)

BF received a call from his friend looking for Secret Pizza....if a sober local guy needed help finding it, gawd help the drunk!

The front of their paper menus just say ""pizzeria"". :)"
