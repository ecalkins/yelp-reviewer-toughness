2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

This is our new fave Mexican place in LV. We still heart Casa Don Juan, but it's way on the other side of town.

The decor is nice, but maybe just a tad dark on the bar side. They brought out chips, salsa and bean dip, all of which were delicious. Best chips and salsa BY FAR that we have had in LV. The food was really really good. My wife had crispy tacos -- she loved the carne asada but didnt care for the chicken. The 13 year old had the ground beef taco and liked it. I had the Quesa Shrimp Tacos, the house specialty, and they were very good (the corn tortillas were ok, not great). The shrimp was SCRUMPTIOUS! Overall, the food was very good. Warning: the portion sizes are HUGE.

I can see what other people are saying about the service. Our server was somewhat indifferent. It took quite a while to get our food. But it didnt ruin our meal, and I wouldnt let it stop you from trying the place.

It was a bit pricey -- $50 for 2 sodas, a 2 taco plate, a 1 taco plate, and the special tacos."
