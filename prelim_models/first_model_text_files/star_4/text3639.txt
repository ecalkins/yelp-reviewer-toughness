Me and the BF just wanted a quick bite without paying too much and so we found this place thru Yelp (would have never found it otherwise! Hence the ""SECRET"" in the name)

Pricey for a slice of pizza ($5-6) but hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect?? Hit the spot completely and just what I needed at 1 AM!"
