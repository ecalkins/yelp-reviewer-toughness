If you are planning to order a whole pizza, call ahead. It is much cheaper for a whole pizza but takes about an hour. For another $10 you can ""cut the line"", and they'll push your order forward. 

I had what everyone else recommend here. All good, definitely greasy. 

Their water machine doesn't work, just a heads up if u were looking for a cup of water."
