I'd read heaps of articles about this place saying how sneakily hidden it was, how difficult it was to find, how only those ""in the know"" knew the location. Total BS. Aside from that, this place serves kick ass pizza for a reasonable price... which is why I had to stand in line for 45 minutes at 4.30am on Friday evening/Saturday morning waiting for my chance to try it out.

I ended up being super boring and predictable and got one slice of their cheese, sausage pepperoni pizza. I didn't bother coming up with my own combo, I didn't bother mixing and matching- my feet were aching and I was so ready to be done with my evening.
Really liked the pizza, it was tasty and not crazy greasy. 10/10 would wait in line for a slice again!"
