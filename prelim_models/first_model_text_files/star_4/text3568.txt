The Service ---
The service was fine.  You order at the counter and they call your name and you pick it up.  It's a tiny little place.

The Food ---
We got 2 pizzas, one cheese and one with mushrooms, bell peppers and pepperoni.  It took about 30 minutes or so for the pizzas to be done but it was worth the wait.  The crust was nice and thin, although I do prefer it to be a little more crunchy on the bottom.  The cheese was delicious.  Overall, great pizza and good at room temperature as well!

The Prices ---
It was a little pricey.  I think the cheese was $24 and the other one was $29 or something.  But the pizzas were huge.  We had 8 people and had about 5 slices or so left.  And it is in Vegas, everything is more expensive in Vegas.  

Yummy yummy pizza!"
