This would be the place to go after 1am. For the price, it's reasonable and good for hangover/buzz. First night, I ordered a whole cheese pizza $26 and it took them 20minutes to baked it fresh. TOTALLy worth it, the cheese was bubbling, the crust was soft and yet crispy. It was perfect!! I downed 2 slices in silence....

On the second night, I speculated that the whole pizza with certain toppings are already made and will be reheated in the oven when you order. I dont think the quality will be the same.  Keep an eye on the fresh pizza as they bring it out and order that!! (hopefully you are sober enough). We ended up getting a slice of sausage cheese pizza and the cashier just handed to us (not a reheat slice.. score!!). I thought the sausage was too salty. I'm still craviing the fresh cheese plain pizzza...."
