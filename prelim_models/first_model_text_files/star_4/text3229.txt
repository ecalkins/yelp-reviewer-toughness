Sometimes the line can suck, but it's so worth it.  You can get a big slice for under $5, I believe it's NY style (thin crust).  Service has almost always been with a smile, and it's so convenient either before or after visiting Marquee.

Hmm... I wish I could speak more of its awesomeness, but I guess I've said it all.  My yelp buddy Rod U said it well, it's not the best pizza in Vegas, but it's an experience.  Hip and trendy, you'll spot a lot of other clubgoers hitting it up.  For its convenience, and quality, I am definitely a fan."
