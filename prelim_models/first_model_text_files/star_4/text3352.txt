After a long night of dancing the night away in KILLER heels you can't help but want to eat some delicious comfort food, and what better place to get it than from a place that calls itself Secret Pizza, everyone loves a good secret ;) If you didn't know about this place before hand, you would probably miss it, and it sure isn't a place to miss! But once you walk down that infamous hall way of frames on frames on frames into this lovely secret spot and smell the lovely aroma of yummy thin crust pizza you'll surely be happy to have found this hidden gem. 

My GO TO dish of course is everything! Order any kind of pizza and your taste buds will be happy little campers. I personally like to keep things simple and stick to the mushroom pizza, so delicious! With a few drinks in me, I could probably eat a whole box of pizza from here easily :P

Try to beat the clubs closing or you will have to wait in a long line for your yummy goodies along side of a bunch of drunk barefoot ladies! X.X

Happy eats, loves! ^_^"
