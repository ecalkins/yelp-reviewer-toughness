Pizza slices were huge, but since I went with a group we decided to get a whole pie for $28 which was a better deal anyways. We had sausages as our topping. The pizza was freshly baked, served super hot which was nice. The crust was crispy  and thin, not super doughy which I liked. Quite oily though I must say - I had to use napkins to tap out some of the oil on top of the pizza. You can sprinkle some chili flakes and extra cheese on top, just bare in mind the chili flakes were actually quite spicy. Overall the pizza was tasty! A good pizza joint if you want to grab a quick bite."
