You spend decades hearing about it being this great town where you can do anything at any time, but really, so much is closed down at night. Sure you can gamble and drink, but we needed sustenance. 

Anyway, we wandered into the Cosmopolitan and wandered to their food court. The ""secret"" pizza place, down a magical tunnel lined with album covers, was a godsend. This wondrous spot, not found on any maps, was the only open eatery we found. 

Picked up a slice of white deep-dish pizza ($9) and it was enough to share. It was a bit on the hard side. I'm sure with it being so late, it had been sitting around longer than it would have during the day. All the same, it tasted great. 

All the stools were taken up, so Bran and I laid about on the vintage chairs they had in the food court common area. It was quiet and away from the hubbub and Axe body spray downstairs. 

Some reviewers mentioned a long line, but at 1 in the morning, we were behind maybe three people."
