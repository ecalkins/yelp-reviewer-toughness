The pizza itself is giant, greasy, and absolutely delicious. After a long night out in Vegas, not much else can hit the spot as perfectly as a slice of the White Pizza can. Secret Pizza is open pretty much all night so it is here for you when you need it most. It is a bit expensive for one slice of pizza, but the slices are really large and after all - it is Las Vegas.

I love the culture of Secret Pizza. Without any real signs, names, or advertisements, calling this place ""Secret Pizza"" is most fitting."
