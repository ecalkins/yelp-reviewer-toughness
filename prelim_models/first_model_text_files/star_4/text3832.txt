Premade slice place, with decent options.  NYC style. 

TIP: if you're looking for 3+ slices, just buy a whole pizza as the price will be the same.  ALSO be weary of weekend nights as lines will wrap long around the hallway.  It's a tight hallway to the place, so claustrophobic patrons may want to stay away as well. 

Flavor was good, but we were disappointed that we didn't order a whole pizza as the few slices we got weren't really filling enough."
