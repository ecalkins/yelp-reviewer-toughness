On this mission, we were taken up and down, left and right through the Cosmopolitan, and we come upon this hallway with vinyl record labels lined on the walls that had no sign, no nothing, which you can easily mistaken for a hallway to a restroom. Once all the way down, the ""secret"" has been revealed that of a pizza parlor. Hm! This better be amazingly good!

I ordered the mushroom pizza, and was highly recommended to get it with meatball on top. It looked amazing, but right when I picked it up for a first bite, the pizza fell apart. Sad. The slice I had was probably too soggy and the crust was really thin that didn't even feel like it was there. However, that doesn't stop the fact that the pizza is absolutely delicious! Gooey cheese with tasty tomato sauce, soft and earthy mushrooms, and the meatball! Omg, the meatball was amazing! Super tasty, meaty, and flavorful.

Sure, the place is dark and dank, but who the hell cares when you're eating pizza THIS good.

I asked my friend what this place was called, and his reply, ""secret."" That confused me. Because he's been saying ""secret, secret, secret"" for days, I thought he was still going that, but nope, he said this place is actually called ""Secret Pizza."" OH! Neat.

I am hooked! One of the best pizzas ever. A must visit on my next venture to Las Vegas."
