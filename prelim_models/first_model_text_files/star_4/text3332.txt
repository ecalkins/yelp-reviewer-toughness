0	Secret Pizza exemplifies what is good about the Cosmopolitan and why people love to stay there. It is simple, cheap, and tasty pizza hidden away down what one might assume at first glance to be a hallway to a restroom. When you are on the strip it is hard to find something reasonable, when you just want a snack, especially if you are young and on a budget. This was one of many good ideas the hotel had for their guests, or in fact anyone who comes through and finds it.
