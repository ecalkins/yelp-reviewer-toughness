If you are having trouble locating the hallway down which Secret Pizza is located, the smell and music help.  Additionally, you'll likely see people eating pizza near a pool table, which lets you know you're in the right vicinity.

When we arrived (Saturday around 12:15), there were already around a half dozen people either eating, ordering, or waiting.  So, given the size of the place, this made it kind of crowded.  There is a bar which circles the edge of the room, but only 6 bar stools that I counted.  This is why people leave and eat on the couches near the pool table.  I had a slice of Sicilian with sausage and a NY slice with meatball and ricotta.  These slices are not cheap when compared to other pizza joints.  A regular slice of cheese thin crust is $5.50.  Fountain drinks, served to you in a red solo cup, are $4.  But, you at least get refills, so there's that.

Both slices were good, but I preferred the thinner crust.  The crust was crunchy yet a little chewy, and the meatballs were FANTASTIC.  I want this recipe.  They went really well with the only thing I would call a bargain at Secret Pizza:  the dollar order of pickled hot peppers.  They aren't too hot, so if you don't like heat, don't be turned off on ordering them.  Nice addition to your slice.  The sausage on the Sicilian was also very good quality, and the pizza had a nice crunch on the crust.  It needed more cheese and sauce, the ratio was off.  This became more noticeable given the thickness of the slice.

I'd absolutely return, and recommend you do so as well.  It may not be so secret anymore, but a good slice of pizza is always welcome."
