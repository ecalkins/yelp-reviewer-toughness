It was so hard to find that my group and I had to help direct a couple of customers in the right direction because they too were puzzled and lost as to where it was located! 

Food: During my visit here I got the sicilian pizza and I must say this may have just been the best pizza I have ever had! I am not exaggerating it was just that good! The crust was doughy yet crispy and they didn't cheap out on the toppings either! My slice in particular came with cheese, tomatoes and some deli meats on it! The portion is also huge so you definitely get your money's worth. 

Service: I came her after Marquee dayclub and there was already a pretty long line that formed when we arrived. This is why there is a one star deduction for the review. I think in total it took about 30 mins or more to get my one slice of pizza. I hope that they find a more efficient way to get people in and out faster in the future! 

Another con is the fact that there is no seating, if possible can you guys furnish the place with some tables and chairs so we can eat in peace! If you need a place to sit then go down the hallway, there you will find some comfortable one seaters! In the end, a majority of us had to just plop down on the floor because there were not enough chairs to go around.   


All in all, love the pizza but hate the slow service and lack of seating !"
