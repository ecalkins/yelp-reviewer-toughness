Ton's of people, pizza flying everywhere, mouths watering etc etc.  The quality is as good as some pizzerias in NYC and definitely better than most joints in DC/VA.  And I'm not comparing this to brick oven pizza cause it's not.  It's your utilitarian slice pizza and it's supposed to be greasy and please don't use a knife and fork.  Fold it in half!!
