Don't know if I'd wait in line for this place, but if its only a few people and you're already in the area looking for food, it's worth a try.

2 slices came out to ~$13 which is pretty pricy, but hey. It's Vegas. The slices are a nice size and come out toasty and delicious.. especially if you've already had a few.

The white pizza was good, and the bf likened the pepperoni pizza to ""sbarro's but better"". It was alright to me. I'd stick with the white or try the meatball next time."
