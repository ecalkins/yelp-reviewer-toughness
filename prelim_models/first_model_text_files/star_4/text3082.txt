We don't usually leave so early from a night club but all of us had a long day, but good thing we did because we got out just in time before more people did so the line for secret pizza was not too long for us! We probably waited a good 15 minutes until we were able to order. I asked the guy over the counter what does he recommend or what's the most popular pizza that people usually order here and he said the White Pizza. So I ordered one slice and it was delicious! It was a bit pricey $5.25 for a thin slice pizza but it was pretty worth it at that time. I think it's a better deal if you order by the pie but it does take awhile for them to make that where as when you order by the slice its already made.
