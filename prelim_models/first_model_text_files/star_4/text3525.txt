My friends and I ordered a whole pizza with pepperoni since we got our money's worth by doing so instead all of just purchasing our own slice or two. Luckily, my friends all like pepperoni so it worked out. I think we paid around $35 for a whole pizza. It was pretty good! It was cheesy, the crust was not too fluffy nor too thin. Perfect amount of marinara sauce. I think it was worth the wait. Next time I come I want to try their pizza with white sauce to see what that's about.

Service was good. Cashier was friendly and all employees looked like they were keeping up with the busy crowd. FYI, they don't give water cups out, you'll have to pay around $5 for bottled water. They serve their fountain drinks in red solo cups haha. But they do free refills."
