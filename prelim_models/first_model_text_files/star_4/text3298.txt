AMBIANCE: 4 - A cute, almost hidden (but not really) joint with barely any seating. It's not really somewhere where you can sit and eat and plan to stay. Way too small for that business. You should really just order a whole pizza, or a series of slices and go to town in your car or in your hotel room or something! 

SERVICE: 4 - They are pretty speedy for the amount of people that they get...but not speedy enough haha! They do have really fun people working behind the scenes though. But they usually don't have time to converse or anything, they're just too busy for that business! 

FOOD: 4 - I think that they have the best pizza in Las Vegas. It's semi-pricey..but it's definitely worth it. It's just so delicious, and I don't even love pizza that much...but this place is so bomb!!! If it wasn't such a hassle to get to in the middle of a hotel, I'd probably grab pizza here all the time!"
