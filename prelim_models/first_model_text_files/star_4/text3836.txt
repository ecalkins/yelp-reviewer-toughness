The line may be long, and there may be shoe-less girls everywhere, but trust me, it is worth the wait. 

I think one thing for me is that this place reminds me of DC, when a night drinking in Adams Morgan always ends with a slice of Jumbo Slice Pizza. 

$5 dollar per slice is way more expensive than your normal Costco slice but there ain't nothing better after a night of fun. Plus, we already sweated and danced all the calories off at the club anyway. Why not indulge?"
