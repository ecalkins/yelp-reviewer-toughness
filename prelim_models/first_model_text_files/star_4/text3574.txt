Second time around was after a Yelp event. I was not hungry, but after all the talk about the pizza I caved and had a piece. No regrets because the white pizza is a must try. Garlic sauce, ricotta cheese, and mozzarella is always a great combination. In fact, I wish I never went to the Spoon and spent that money on two of these pies. 

The crust is perfection. I am selfish and go for the dark pieces because that is where the magic lies. That crunch still replays itself as I am writing this.

As always, come with friends, because good food should always be accompanied with good conversation. Sit outside by the pool table for comfortable chitchat and forget about it."
